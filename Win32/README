			      Win32 STk
			     -----------


This is the first port of STk on Win32. It has been compiled with BC++
4.5 and MS VC 4.2.Things are far from perfect, and there are a lot of
little things to correct (mostly problem with filename conventions
which are different between Unix and DOS). These problem shoulds be
corrected in future releases.

Compilation
-----------

With BC++ 4.5, just type "make -f STk-make.bc " in the current
directory to build the executable. and "stk-inst" to install the
package.  Don't forget to set your STK_LIBRARY variable to the
directory where the package has been installed.

Limitations:
-----------
The following limitations are mainly due to the fact that I'm not a Windows 
programmer and that I try to spend as less as possible time on this system. 
Consequently, I will probably not try to implements the following for 
a while. The biggest limitations are 
	- no dynamic loading


The help of a window guru for these tasks would be greatly appreciated.
