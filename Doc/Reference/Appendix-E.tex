\section*{Introduction}

This appendix lists the main differences\footnote{ Only the
  differences which affect the language or new ports are reported here.
  In particular, internal changes, packages written in Scheme or
  performance enhancement are not discussed here.}.among the various
recent versions of STk.  Differences with older versions as well as
implementation changes are described in the CHANGES file located in
the main directory of the STk distribution.

\section*{Release 3.1.1}

\small{\emph{Release date: 09/26/96}}

This release is a bug correction release. It corrects a lot of bugs.
A lot of these bugs prevent to install it on some architectures.


\section*{Release 3.1}

\small{\emph{Release date: 07/24/96}}

\begin{itemize}
\item Version of Tk is now at Tk4.1 level.
\item STk has been ported on Windows 95 and Windows NT. 
\item Ports can have a handler which is executed when port becomes
  readable or writable (see primitives \texttt{when-port-readable} and
  \texttt{when-port-writable}.
\item Sockets in server mode allow multiple concurrent connection.
\item \stklos{}: Two new methods: \texttt{object-eqv?} and
  \texttt{object-equal?} which are called when applying \texttt{eqv?} 
  or \texttt{equal?} to instances.
\item New primitive:\texttt{setenv!}
  
\end{itemize}
\section*{Release 3.0} 

\small{\emph{Release date: 01/22/96}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Version of Tk is at Tk4.0p2 level.
\item Closures are fully supported by Tk. That means that a callback can be 
  now a  Scheme closure with its environment. GC problems with closures
  and usage of the dirty \texttt{address-of} are definitively gone.
\item Strings can contain null charters (printing of strings is more
  friendly in write mode).
\item Signals can  be redirected to Scheme closures. The end of a GC 
 is seen as a signal.
\item Traces on variables are changed (and re-work now): the
  associated trace must be a thunk.
\item  New options for some widgets to be more friendly with Scheme world
\item \stklos{}: if a method M is defined and if it is already bound
  to a procedure, the old procedure is called when no method is
  applicable.
  \begin{scheme}
(define-method car ((x <integer>)) (- x 1))
(car 10)           \lev 9
(car (cons 'a 'b)) \lev a
  \end{scheme}
\item Small change in the STklos hierarchy. \texttt{<widget>} is now a
  subclass of \texttt{<procedure>} and its meta class is 
  \texttt{<procedure-metaclass>}.
\end{itemize}
