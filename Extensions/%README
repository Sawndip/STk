Extensions directory
--------------------

This file contains extensions of the core interpreter which can be dynamically
loaded. See the file README in the release main directory to see the systems
for which dynamic loading support exists.

Two extensions are provided as exemples:

	- stack.c: a (very simple) package providing the stack type to the 
	  interpreter. This package is presented in the documentation
	  about STk interpreter extension.
	- when.c: an implementation of when and unless

Other extensions ar more "useful":

	- stklos.c + gf.c: all that is necessary for STklos
	- hash.c: a package for hash-table in Scheme (the one used by STklos)
	- pixmap.c: an extension for adding the XPM (pixmap) format to Tk4.0
	  This extension is due to:
		Harald Albrecht
		albrecht@igpm.rwth-aachen.de
		Institut fuer Geometrie und Praktische Mathematik, RWTH Aachen
		Aachen, Germany
	- html.c: a little extensions useful for (fast) html management
	- process.c: an extension which provide process access to STk
	- posix.c: a set of POSIX.1 fucntions for STk. Must be completed
	- socket.c: simple support (and hence limited) for sockets. It allows you
	  to make simple clients and servers program using TCP/IP
	- sregexp.c Regular expressions


For more informations on extension building, read the document "Extending the
STk Interpreter" provided with the package.
