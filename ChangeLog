Thu Sep 26 19:38:42 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>
	    
	* STk-3.1.1 Release

	* Demos/amib.stklos: Accessing help is now stk:show-help-file (the
	  change was not reported)

Wed Sep 25 14:40:21 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/slib.c (STk_delete_Tcl_child_Interp): new function which must
	  called by a child process just after a fork. This function is
	  necessary to allow the dynamic loading of posix.so in snow
	  (otherwise some Tk symbols are undefined).

	* Extensions/posix.c (posix_fork): Use now STk_delete_Tcl_child_Interp.

	* Src/number.c: Interface has been added for the Frank Schmuelling
	  complex-number package. Don't rely on it, since rationnal and
	  complex numbers will be present in a future release. As soon as the
	  full tower will be implemented in STk, this door will be closed.

Tue Sep 24 18:26:06 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Lib/dialog.stk: The text of the dialog was reset to a message,
	  instead of a label (when was the change done?)

Mon Sep 23 22:52:10 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/signal.c: A lot of modifications in signal handling. Major
	  rewrite of some procedures.  The '^Z' signal works again.  BTW, I
	  was unable to correctly catch a SEGV on linux (which is necessary to
	  find that no more memory is available on Linux, since malloc never
	  returns NULL this OS. Need more work.

Sun Sep 22 23:54:44 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>


	* Src/toplevel.c (finish_initialisation): replaced the hard-coded
	  call to signal when using -f option to a call to the
	  STk_set_signal_handler.

	* Src/slib.c (cannot_allocate): new private procedure called when
	  there is no more memory during a must_malloc or a must_realloc (the
	  old behaviour was incorrecte since it uses cons whereas there was no
	  more memory, conducting to a buggy report-error message). However,
	  the copy on write schem used by Linux cannot be detected by this
	  procedure. It seems that we have to wait a SIGSGV signal.

Tue Sep 17 10:03:49 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/toplevel.c: Bug correction: only create the stdin handler when
	  the process is interactive (Otherwise, STk interpreters launched in
	  backgound by system keep locked -- heavily used in the
	  Doc/README.html demo)

	* STklos/Tk/Composite/Multipaned.stklos: Orientation of Multi-paned
	  didn't work since it was done with differents keywords (:orientation
	  and :position) in some places (thanks to MIZUSHIMA Kazunori 
	  <mizkaz@keiou.trad.pfu.co.jp>)

Fri Sep 13 08:22:41 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STklos/Tk/Tk-methods.stklos: Bug correction in a method of focus
	  (Erik Ostrom <eostrom@research.att.com>)

	* Src/io.c: 
	* Src/port.c: char-ready? was incorrect when used on stdin 
	  (thanks to  Erick Ostrom)

	* STklos/Tk/Text.stklos: Correction of the value field of text
	  widgets. Tk always add a newline at end of buffer.

	* Lib/tk-init.stk (%redefine-Tk-command): After STklos was loaded,
	  each call to focus implies the loafing of file focus.stk !!

	* Extensions/socket.c: Added support for sockets on Win32 (thanks to
	  Caleb Deupree <cdeupree@erinet.com>)

	* Src/unix.c: Added the VC++ support for file globbing (thanks to
	  Caleb Deupree <cdeupree@erinet.com>)

Wed Sep 11 23:05:32 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/tk-main.c: command line argument handling for -geometry was
	  broken. Thanks to Harvey J. Stein <abel@netvision.net.il>

Fri Sep  6 18:20:28 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Extensions/stack.c: Replaced FILEPTR by PORT_FILE in the stack
	  demo. Thanks to Jean-Marie Kubek <kubek@gmm.insa-tlse.fr>

	* configure.in: Get rid of '-n' on echo commands. This option is not
	  supported under Solaris 2.x

Wed Sep  4 13:16:38 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* configure.in: X11 libs/includes in non standard place were not taken
	  into account even when a --x-libraries or a --x-includes was given
	  to the configure script.

Mon Sep  2 10:46:06 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Tk: updraded to Tk4.1p1

	* Src/eval.c: Bug correction in eval.c: arguments were not evaluated
	  when the generic function is implemented in Scheme rather than in C.
	  (Thanks to Jean-Christophe Pazzaglia <pazzagli@arsenic.unice.fr>)

	* Lib/dialog.stk: Added a binding to the dialog window that sets the
	  result to -1; this is needed in case something happens that destroys
	  the window, such as its parent window being destroyed.

Thu Aug 29 13:43:13 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/slib.c (STk_quit_interpreter): replaced Tcl_DeleteInterp by a
	  call to delete the command ".". Otherwise, when the interpreter
	  delete all the commands and find ".", the process becomes
	  recursive. This yield problems when the interpreter has already
	  allocated images.

Sat Aug 24 15:48:40 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/io.c (STk_getc): Bug correction: when a handler was set on
	  stdin, and the process was interactive, the system loops
	  indefinitely.

	* Lib/text.stk: Typo on *tk-strict-motif* for <ButtonRelease-2>

Fri Aug 23 22:24:33 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/toplevel.c (finish_initialisation): Modifications to allow
	  using stdin when using the "-f" option. Signaled by Erik Ostrom
	  <eostrom@research.att.com>

Sat Aug 17 11:21:30 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/io.c: Tcl_DoOneEvent parameter was "TK_DONT_WAIT", which is no
	  more necessary and which greatly increase cpu usage when used
	  interactively. Tcl_DoOneEvent is now 0

Tue Aug 13 18:00:10 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STklos/Tk/Composite/*.stklos: Avoid to use a (require
	  "Tk-classes") since it can condut to problem if normal widget have
	  been loaded by hand before (i.e. without using Tk-classes)

	* Lib/posix.stk: The definition of posix-access? was inverted.

	* Src/posix.c (posix_access): corrected error messages typos.

	* Mp/Makefile: replaced make by $(MAKE)

	* New directory: Doc/LaTeX-packages: This dictory contains packages	
	 which ares used in documentation but which are absent from some
	 Latex distributions.

	* Lib/process.stk: mispelling in string-append. Grrr.

	* Tk/configure: Bug correction: Not everybody has "." in its PATH.

	* Tk/unix/Makefile.in: Bug correction signalled by
	  Matthew.R.Wette@jpl.nasa.gov for X11 include files placed in non
	  standard place

	* Lib/Makefile: Bug correction signalled by
	  Matthew.R.Wette@jpl.nasa.gov when installing Lib files

	* configure.in: Changed Linux 2.x namimg scheme (I forgot that Linux
	  is now in 2.0!)

Wed Jul 24 00:04:49 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STk-3.1 Release

	* Src/stklos.c: The slot "name" in methods (which was always (buggyly)
	  set to "???")  is gone.  A new slot replace it:
	  "generic-function". The value of this slot is the generic function
	  to which the method belongs.

	  Anonymous function have a "generic-function" set to #f.

	  Potential problem: an anonymous method can be added to two different
	  GFs. In this case, the slot "generic-function" will be incorrect.
	  However, this should not be a problem since
		1. anonymous method are rare
		2. this is only used by STklos to find the class of the gf
		   (and not the gf itself) of a method when there is no
		   next-method when we applying a next-method....

	* Tk/unix/tkUnixWm.c: A lot of adaptation to Scheme (empty lists
          replaced by #f, mainly). This modificcations were needed for amib
	  whose save/restore didn't work in 3.0.

	* Tk/generic/tkPlace.c: Bug correction in the info suboption

Tue Jul 23 10:11:28 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/argv.c (STk_process_argc_argv): has been rewritten and is 
	 table driven now. Parameters are processed analysed
	 differently now: the "--" option has been added to allow a clear
	 separation between interpreter arguments and scripts arguments 
	 (as in Tcl). However, interpreter arguments must precede scripts
	 arguments (this is different from Tcl, but more Unixish).

	* Src/tk-main.c: Bug correction: if visual was incorrect the program
	 enter in an infinite loop.

	* Doc/Makefile: Tk Manuals pages are now prefixed by "stk_"
	to avoid confusion with original Tk ones. They are always placed
	in a subtree of the STk tree installation since it eases 
	the distribution of binary releases. 

	* New demo: mc-server a multiple-client server. This is a first 
	version, because this demo should be graphical to see connections
	and deconnection as they arrive. (Next release)

Mon Jul 22 15:53:44 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* BINARY_DISTRIB: description of the way to make binary releases.
	  Binary release will be stored in ftp://kaolin.unice.fr/Binary

	* Lib/init.stk:
	  Lib/Makefile.in:  Adding a site-scheme directory. This is
	  the standard directory for non standard stuff. Local scheme
	  files or extensions  can be put in this directory.

Sun Jul 21 17:53:35 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Lib/init.stk: added the variable *shared-suffix*. It is equal to
	  "so", except on HP-UX whers it is set to "sl". All the Lib/*.stk*
	  files haves been modified to use this variable rather than hardcode
	  the usual ".so".  I hope it will be OK for HP users.

	* Src/port.c (STk_open_file): new mode accepted "a" (for append).

Fri Jul 19 14:36:04 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/posix.c: 
	   - Renamed posix-access to posix-access? (old name exists
	     for compatibility but will be garbaged in afuture version)
	   - Added the constant X_OK which was missing

Thu Jul 11 22:21:30 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/posix.c: New primitives: posix_host_name and posix_domain_name
	 based on gethostname and getdomainname (POSIX.1 does not define
	 these functions, but ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990 mentions them in B.4.4.1.,
	 according to the Linux documentation.

	* Src/posix.c: New primitive: posix-uname

Fri Jul  5 19:41:38 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Lib/html.stk: Addition of the <FONT> tag with SIZE and COLOR
	  sub-tags. This must be compatible with the HTML spec.  The <COLOR>
	  tag which was STk-specific is deleted

Mon Jun 10 00:05:16 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Port implementation is different: A port contains now its
	input and output handler. String ports have been changed accordingly.
	
Sat Jun  1 21:23:01 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STk works on Win32: However, there are a lot of minor
	  things which are not correct (fonts, cursors). It seems that
	  most of this small problems are already resolved with Tk 4.1 
	  (the official one). OK, start to port from Tk4.1a2 to Tk 4.1.
	  The main probleme will very probably be with the event loop.

Mon May 27 10:42:58 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Renaming files in STklos/Tk and STklos/Tk/Composite: they have now
	a .stklos suffix (rather than .stk), because Win32 filenames are not 
	really case sensitives.

Sat May 11 08:33:22 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Integration of code modification for WIN32 port (snow only)

Fri Apr 26 09:26:10 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/primitives.c:
	* Src/gc.c:
	* Src/tcl-lib.c: Widgets don't capture anymore the environment. This
	was necessary before release 3.0, but useless now. As a matter of
	fact, widget-environment primitive has also been suppressed. Since it
	was never documented, I doubt that someone will cry for it.

	* Src/cont.c: Bug: Changed "#ifdef sun" by "#ifdef sparc" for 
	flushing the registers window Useful for Sun3 (bug signaled 
	by Michael A. Patton <MAP@BBN.com>)

	* Lib/menu.stk: Tk:option-menu: function added (identical to the 
	Tcl one)

Thu Apr 25 23:10:37 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Tk/generic/tkMenu.c: Bug correction: tearoffmenucommand was not
	defined as a closure.  

Wed Apr 24 16:21:42 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	  * Src/stklos.c: New protocol around gf: the following methods are now
	  called when an error occur with a gf call:
		  * no-next-method ((gf <generic>) args) as CLOS
		  * no-applicable-method ((gf <generic>) args) as CLOS
		  * no-method ((gf <generic>) args) when calling gf
						    without method

Tue Apr 23 23:02:26 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STklos/stklos.stk: New protocol for calling standard generic
	  functions.  This protocol is not used for real <generic> function (in
	  this case we use a completly C hard-coded protocol).  When a subclass
	  of <generic> is applied, the interpreter uses the new protocol instead
	  of the C one. This "opens" the generic function mechanism:
		  - special generic function can easily coded in Scheme (but
		    they will be slow)
		  - standard generic functions are as fast as possible.

	  This protocol provides the following generic functions:
		  * apply-generic ((gf <generic>) args)
		  * sort-applicable-methods ((gf <generic>) methods args)
		  * method-more-specific? ((m1 <method>) (m2 <method>) targs)

Mon Apr 22 23:50:18 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/boolean.c:
	* Src/proc.c:
	* Src/print.c:
	* Src/gc.c: 
	* Src/stklos.c: 
	* Src/eval.c: STklos integration. Generic functions are recognized now
	by the interpreter as standard STk objects (i.e. stklos is no more a
	dynamically loadable extension).  This integration provides:
		- faster gf (the old way to implement gf is very general and
		  is not efficient (each call to a generic function implied
		  to search the way to apply the generic function in a table).
		- gf are now properly tail recursive.

Fri Apr 19 23:53:32 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/print.c: Change -- address printing: the "#p" is no more used
	when displaying an address.  The #p is kept for Tk (of course) and
	when using write.

Sun Apr 14 19:05:50 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Demos/compo-demo.stklos: New compo-demo for <Multiple-window>

	* STklos/Tk/Composite/Multiwin.stk: 2 new composite widgets:
	<Multiple-window>: a window which can contain several windows
	<Inner-window>   : a window embedded in a <Multiple-window>
	The look is very similar to the Windows 95 explorer.

Sat Apr 13 21:58:18 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Tk/generic/tkEvent.c (Tk_AfterCmd): Bug correction for after idle

Sun Mar 31 22:38:54 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/unix.c: New primitive: setenv!

Fri Mar 29 15:06:46 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/gc.c (allocate_new_heap): Don't use must_malloc here since it
	can conduct to call GC when allocating large heaps (typically with
	large -cells xxx).

Mon Mar 25 14:20:21 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STklos/Tk/Canvas.stk: bind-for-dragging: bug correction end
	enhancement. You can now specify a :before-motion and :after-motion
	scripts. The old :motion is always accepted
	(it's equivalent to :after-motion). If the :before-motion closure
	returns #f, the object is not displaced and the :after-motion closure 
	is not applied.

Mon Feb 26 16:11:30 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STklos/stklos.stk: Two new methods are defined in STklos:
	object-eqv? and object-equal?.  They are called when doing an eqv? or
	an equal? on STklos instance.  These methods, which can of course be
	specialized, return #f.

	* Src/boolean.c: Extended types can now have a compare function which
	is called when eqv? or equal? is called. This function is called when
	one of the arguments of eq*? is of an extended type. See the document
	on Extending STk for details.

Sat Feb 24 01:47:06 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Port of STk on Tk4.1a2.
	This should simplify the port on Windows.

Mon Feb 19 17:19:49 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/toplevel.c (repl_driver): STk_interactivep was not correctly
	initialized. This seem to be a regression (or a quirk in the home &
	work files)

Fri Feb 16 14:49:48 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/number.c (do_integer_division): Correction of a bug signalled by
	Raymond Toy <toy@rtp.ericsson.se>. Integer division of bignums was
	buggy (aka Pentium symptom (except that it was always erroneous)).

Mon Feb 12 00:03:55 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Extensions/pixmap.c: Pixmap implementation uses now the file
	tixImgXpm.c from the Tix Library (Author: Ioi Kim Lam). This
	implementation doesn't need the Xpm library (which is difficult to
	locate automatically with configure script and which has several
	version with compatibily problems).

Wed Jan 24 11:52:49 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/print.c (STk_print): Bug correction. Print of special char in
	Strings was buggy.  Thanks Drew.Whitehouse@anu.edu.au for signalling
	it.  have also added \v and \a that I have forgot.

	* STklos/Tk/Composite/Scrollcanvas.stk: Correcting a small typo error
	signaled by Ralf Berger <Ralf.Berger@ipk.fhg.de>.

Sun Jan 21 23:57:37 1996 Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STk-3.0 (official) release (aka known as 3.0b2 since I have forgot to
	set the correct version name.

Sun Dec 10 21:37:17 1995  Erick Gallesio  <eg@biot.unice.fr (Erick Gallesio)>

	* Src/promise.c (STk_force):
	Bug correction for recursive expression in a force. It is now conform
	to R4RS.
	   (define c #f)
	   (define p (delay (if c 100 (begin (set! c #t) (+ (force p) 1)))))
	returns now the value 100 (and not 101).
	This bug was raised with test.scm.

	*******************
	Changelog was not maintained for a while. I will try to update 
	it later. Sorry.

	* 2.2 Release
	* Src/syntax.c (STk_syntax_begin): begin, and & or were not always
	tail recursives. This bug was detected (and corrected) by  Lars Thomas
	Hansen <lth@cs.uoregon.edu>
	* Doc/Reference/Reference2.tex: Documentation of new hash tables

Sun Jul 16 10:30:26 1995  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Snow/run-snow.in: 
	* Src/run-stk.in: I have changed the machine determination scheme 
	to avoid problems on Sun (sun4m sun4 sun4c... are all the same, at 
	least for STk). For Linux, there is no more differerence between 
	the Intel rocessor used for compiling STk (i{345}86 are all the same).

	* Src/dynload.c: 
	* Src/configure.in:
	* Src/Makefile.in:
	* configure.in:
	* Makefile.in: Support for ELF format under Linux. Thanks to
	Johann Friedrich Heinrichmeyer and <jsc2mit.edu>

	* Doc/Extension/Extending.tex: Adding documentation for Tcl widget 
	integration

Thu Jul 13 09:04:54 1995  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Doc/Reference/Appendix-D.tex: Description of Ilisp, CMU Scheme packages
	* Doc/Manual/stk.txt: New manual page. Manual page is now installed in 
	$(prefix)/man/man1/stk.1

	stdin. 

	* Src/stk.h: 
	* Src/toplevel.c: 
	* Src/argv.c: New option: -interactive to force the
	interpreter to be interactive, even if it doesn't seem to
	be. This is useful when using STk under Emacs. 
	When STk is interactive, stdout and stderr are now unbuffered.
	* Src/port.c (STk_init_standard_ports): line buffering of Stderr has been 
	deleted. Everything is done now in toplevel.c (depends on the
	-interactive flag

	* Lib/regexp.stk: Bug correction in regexp-replace-all when replacing
	string appears in the string to replace. Correction is due to
	Sean Slattery <jslttery@GS148.SP.CS.CMU.EDU>

Wed Jul 12 09:57:10 1995  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr (Erick Gallesio)>

	* Src/syntax.c (syntax_let_family): Don't signal an error if a
	symbol is defined twice in a let*. Formal semantics given in R4RS
	allows it (whereas textual explanation seems to forbid it.
	Problem was found by Brent Knight <knight@CS.Cornell.EDU>.

	* Src/port.c: New definition of macro READ_DATA_PENDING for
	ELF compiling. Thanks to Jin S. Choi <jsc@tabitha.atype.com>
	for the bug correction.

	* Lib/init.stk: Macros are now defined in the global environment. 
	This avoids problems when some primitives procedure are redefined.
	All the primitive should be protected for those redefinitions.

	* Lib/Makefile (install): prolog.ps is now placed in the good directory

	* Tk/tkCanvas.c (CanvasWidgetCmd): Correction of a bug signaled by
	Johann Friedrich Heinrichmeyer. The result of the poscript command
	must be "stringified".
	

Tue Jul 11 21:16:17 1995  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr (Erick Gallesio)>

	* STklos/Tk/Canvitem.stk (initialize-item): INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE
	<Text> in canvas has been renamed in <Canvas-text> to avoid a conflict 
	when using both cnavases and texts widgets.
	Demos have been modified to take this modification into account

	* STklos/Tk/Composite/Scrollcanvas.stk (<Scroll-canvas>):
	* STklos/Tk/Composite/Scrollbox.stk (<Scroll-listbox>): Bug correction in 
	background propagation. (Bug signaled by H. J. Stein)
 

Tue Jul 11 16:31:44 1995  Erick Gallesio  <eg@kaolin.unice.fr (Erick Gallesio)>

	* Correction of several bugs signaled by Eric Ostrom on text widget

Fri Jul  7 23:27:17 1995  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr (Erick Gallesio)>

	* Tk/tkWindow.c (Tk_CreateMainWindow): 
	* Src/toplevel.c (init_interpreter): Init system path from
	STK_LIBRARY shell variable. This variable MUST be initialized now
	(this is done in the stk or snow scripts). This allows us to make 
	binaries which are independant of their location. This will permit 
	to distribute binaries on kaolin.

	* Src/hash.c: Modification of the hash table module to take into
	account an optional parameter which specifies the comparison function.
	This permits to have equal? eqv? eq? or string? hash tables for instance
	
Tue Jul  4 14:04:49 1995  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr (Erick Gallesio)>

	* Src/port.c:
	* Src/sport.c: Minor code cleaning (using STk_is_thunk)

Fri Jun 23 22:27:26 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* STklos/Tk/Composite/Scrolltext.stk (<Scroll-text>): bug correction
	in background propagation	

Mon Jun  5 18:03:47 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* STk-2.1.7 release

	* Extensions/posix.c: An extension for using Posix primitives in
	Scheme.  Far from complete. This is just a start. Any help on this
	point would be appreciated.

	* Doc/Extension/Extending.tex: A new version which is more (but not
	totally :-<) complete.  
	* Extensions/stack.c: a new file used for illustating the document
	  "Extending the STk interpreter"

	* Demos/amib.stklos: A new version of the interfac builder which
	is usable now. This version handle the packer and the placer.

	* STklos/Tk/Composite/Multipaned.stk (initialize-composite-widget):
	  Addition of the Multipaned composite widget. Thanks to Harvey J. Stein,
	  for his modifications.

Sat Jun  3 00:44:53 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* Lib/init.stk:
	* Src/syntax.c: Rewritting of "while" and "unless" in C

	* A new type: tc_ssubr. This type is temporary and will change in
	 the next release.  This type correspond to all n-ary functions of
	 number.c.  Correction of an ENNORMEOUS bug: There was a double
	 evaluation when fsubr where called by apply!!!. Fsubr cannot be
	 applyed now (ssubr are the only procedure with non evaluated
	 parameter which can be appyed.

	* Src/proc.c (STk_procedurep): (Procedure? a-tk-command) => #t now
	* Lib/inspect-misc.stk (inspect::typeof obj): correction of a bug
	introcuced in the inspector by previous modification

Fri Jun  2 00:07:20 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* Src/gf.c (find_method): Code cleaning.

Thu Jun  1 19:29:39 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* Src/port.c (do_load): I have added a comment when a file has
	  finished to be loaded, as suggested by David Fox.

	* Src/gc.c (gc_sweep): GC calls now Tcl_DeleteCommand when a new
	  command is deleted. See below ...  

	* Src/tcl-lib.c: Modifications of {Create,Delete}Interp and
	  {Create,Delete}Command to really execute the detete code of a
	  Tk-command. This seems to be useful only for the send command
	  annd "."  command (but would also be probably useful for future
	  tcl extensions).  The "send" associated delete proc permits to
	  unregister the interpreter from the X server (bug signalled by
	  Sean Slattery slttery@GS148.SP.CS.CMU.EDU and that I have never
	  seen !!!!).

Mon May 29 17:04:53 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* STklos/Tk/Message.stk (<Message>): Deleteing the class
	  <Tk-sizeable> from <Message> class. This was erroneous.

Fri May 26 23:52:40 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* STklos/Tk/Toplevel.stk (<Toplevel>): Adding the :init-keyword
	  for class and display slots. This modification was necessary for
	  the new AMIB.  Min-size and max-size slots contain now a string
	  and class and display slots contain a string (it was a symbol) 

	* STklos/Tk/Frame.stk (<Frame>): Adding the :init-keyword for
	  class slot Class slot contains a string (it was a symbol)

Fri May 19 22:44:59 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* Src/sport.c (STk_get_output_string): Correction of a bug
	  signalled by Fritz.Heinrichmeyer@fernuni-hagen.de

Wed May  3 12:59:24 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* STklos/Tk/Composite/Paned.stk (motion-grip): Applying the patch
	  of Harvey J. Stein <hjstein@MATH.HUJI.AC.IL> which constraints
	  the grip ]0..1[ This permits to avoid its disappearance.

Tue May  2 00:05:55 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* STklos/Tk/Tk-methods.stk: This file is always loaded now (it was
	  loaded only when Tk was initialized before). Read the comment in
	  this file when re-using STk images. *top-root* initialization is
	  in Tk-methods.stk rather than Toplevel.stk now.

	* Lib/tk-init.stk (Tk:initialized?): a new variable which is set
	  to #t when Tk is fully initialized


Mon May  1 16:55:18 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* Src/stklos.c (display_instance): 
	* Src/error.c (STk_err): 
	* Src/eval.c (STk_show_eval_stack): 
	* Src/port.c (STk_write): 
	* Src/tk-glue.c (STk_convert_for_tk): 
	* Src/toplevel.c (repl_loop): 
	* Src/extend.c (internal_display): 
	* Src/print.c (STk_print):    All those files have been modified for
	  giving the port (a SCM object) to the procedure which do a print
	  rather than a FILE *, which is more general. This modification is
	  necessary for permitting a real display_object in extension.  STklos
	  uses this for the {write,display,tk-write}-object methods.

Tue Apr 25 14:57:48 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/number.c (STk_gcd): Bug correction in lcm, gcd, min and max (arguments
	  were evaluated several times!!!!). 

Tue Apr 18 14:55:23 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* STklos/Tk/Composite/Scrolltext.stk: New file. It implements what
	  you think it should!!

	* STklos/Tk/Composite/Scrollcanvas.stk: New file. It implements
	what you think it should!!

	* STklos/Tk/Composite/Scrollbox.stk (<Scroll-listbox>): Scroll
	listbox accept now horizontal scrollbar.

Sat Apr 15 15:40:40 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* Tk/tkListbox.c (ListboxWidgetCmd): Correction of an old old bug:
	Getting an element of listbox always retusrns a string. However,
	this modification breaks down the inspector.... (it is time to
	rewrite it....)

Fri Apr 14 23:32:42 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* Src/number.c (STk_round): Bug correction. (Round x) must returns
	the closest integer to x, rounding to even when x is halfway
	between two integers.

Fri Mar 31 00:15:36 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* Src/configure.in: Adding test for the existence of the pid_t
	type.  This is needed for porting STk on Sony WS (Sony NEWS,
	NEWSOS 4.2R) Thanks to Nobuyuki Hikichi <hikichi@sra.co.jp>

	* Lib/init.stk (random): have been extended to allow the result to
	be a bignum. Here again, thanks to Nobuyuki Hikichi
	<hikichi@sra.co.jp>

Sat Mar 25 23:33:54 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* STk/read.c: Modification of the reader to remember current
	filename and line counters. This eases debugging since error
	messages can display those informations.

Thu Mar 16 15:32:59 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/extend.c (STk_define_C_variable): New function. This
	function permit to establish a link between a C variable and a
	Scheme one. Once this link is established, every reading of the
	variable will call a getter function and every write will call the
	setter function. No data is used in the Scheme space, variable
	value is a C data.

Wed Mar 15 17:21:40 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* New primitive type: C-pointer. This is a Scheme type to wrap a C
	pointer.  It greatly eases communication with C.

	* Src/extend.c: New file. This file contains all the code for
	extensions and C pointers. It contains a ot of code from old
	dynload.c.  File dynload.c contains now only the function which do
	dynamic loadind (and which is very sytem dependant.

Tue Mar 14 13:30:11 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/slib.c (STk_internal_eval_string): Bug correction. The error
	context was false.

Fri Mar 10 15:55:47 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/userinit.c (STk_user_cleanup): STk_user_cleanup has been added. 

	* Src/port.c (STk_init_standard_ports): Error file is now line
	buffered. This gives better performances when used under emacs.


Thu Mar  9 12:49:43 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Added support for dynamic loading under Linux (with DLD). Code
	is inspired from a contribution of Patrick Nguyen
	(pnguyen@elde.epfl.ch)

Sun Mar  5 16:06:11 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* Src/port.c (STk_char_readyp): Added support for char-ready. Code
	should not be very portable...

Sat Feb 25 11:51:45 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* Src/slib.c (STk_get_internal_info): Bug correction: the result
	was completely erroneous. Is it possible that I have tested this
	function without having seen this????

	* Dynamic loading should work for OSF1 (Thanks to Erik Ostrom
	<eostrom@radon.ccs.neu.edu>)

Sun Feb 12 18:00:15 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* 2.1.6 release

Sat Feb 11 23:23:15 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* Src/env.c (STk_parent_environment): New function. It was time to
	write it...

	* Src/port.c (STk_error): Set context to ERR_OK but keep the bit
	indicating if error must be caught or not.

	* New version of blt for STk. Some minor changes for compiling it
	with new C conventions.

Thu Feb  9 23:21:52 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* STklos/Tk/Basics.stk: Tk::find-option is defined as autoload to
	permit image creation.

	* STklos/Tk/Toplevel.stk: Definition of *top-root* is deferred
	until first <Toplevel> creation (to allow image creation)

	* STklos/Tk/Tk-methods.stk: New file. This file contains the
	redefinition of Tk commands as methods. This file is loaded when
	the first Tk object is really created. Deferring the loading of
	this file permits to make images of interpreters containing Tk
	classes.


Thu Feb  2 23:15:15 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* Src/unix.c (absolute): Bug correction for file name with mutiple
	dots such as "...1../2" which were improperly expanded

	* Src: Yeaaah. All the symbols defined by STk are now prefixed by
	"STk_".  It tooks me some days to obtain this. I take this
	occasion to pass through the code and try to ameliorate things
	rather than using brute force.

Wed Feb  1 02:17:12 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* Socket support has been rewritten. It is now configured by
	default.  New model seems more simple (at least for me) and more
	coherent with the process extension.

Tue Jan 31 10:30:29 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Modification of all Makefile to use $(MAKE) rather than make as
	suggested by Christian Lynbech <lynbech@daimi.aau.dk>

Mon Jan 30 15:22:06 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Tk/tkConfig.h: Modifications for HPUX.

Sun Jan 29 15:11:06 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* Src/process.c: Completely cleaned up. Table of processes is
	managed by the SIGCHLD signal if it exists. On machines without
	job control, process management is done by hand. Some new function
	have been added (suggested on the mailing list by Giorgio Cesana
	<cesana@venus.agcis.st.it>): process-exit-status, process-stop,
	process-continue, process-send-signal.

	(run_process): A new option: ":host" which permits to execute the command 
	on a distant host.

Mon Jan 23 12:07:23 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/tk-main.c (Tk_main): adding code for managing argument line
	-geometry option. It was missing....

	* Src/stklos.c (make_primitive_classes): Adding the new primitive
	class <list> which is the ancestor of <pair> and <null>. Suggested
	by Harvey J. Stein (hjstein@math.huji.ac.il)

Sun Jan 22 18:12:02 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* Demos/inspector.stk: A small demo, for showing usage of the
	inspector with Tk object. A very simple thing but this seems to be
	rather unknown.

Sat Jan 21 23:01:15 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* Src/read.c (lreadr): Cosmetic changes. Using the sym_XXX
	variables instead of interning them at each time.

	* Src/gc.c (allocate_new_heap): Setting of the field gc_mark to 0
	for all new allocated cell. Thanks to Chet Murphy
	<murthy@CS.Cornell.EDU> for this bug correction.

	* Src/toplevel.c (init_interpreter): Bug correction: sym_unquote
	was gc protected twice whereas sym_unquote_splicing was not. A
	cut/paste error which took 2 days to debug :-(


Mon Jan  9 12:06:08 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Configure and Mafefile files modifications to allow dynamic
	loading under Irix 5.3. Thanks to Michael Tiemann
	<tiemann@cygnus.com> for the patches.

Sun Jan  1 21:10:45 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* One important thing :-) Adding 1995 in all the files which
	contains a copyright notice. This is the good day for doing that
	(an only that!).

Fri Dec 30 17:56:40 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* New organization of Tcl files. All The Tcl files have been
	updated to release 7.4b1 (the Tcl release that comes with Tk
	4.0b1).  The file Src/tcl-util.c has shrink a lot and most of it
	is now in Tcl/tlUtil.c (in fact a copy of the original file with
	some #ifdefs).  This last change is break the previous philosophy
	of libtcl.a (a library of Tcl file *unmodified*) but changes are
	minor and I hope that it will ease the port to new version of
	Tcl/Tk which semble very instable at this time.

Wed Dec 28 18:14:22 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* Lib/error.stk (report-error): Modification of error message format

	* Src/primitives.c: Deleting the definition of the "lindex"
	primitive which doesn't serve anymore.

Tue Dec 20 12:02:00 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/syntax.c (syntax_define): "Bug" correction: When using a
	local "define", There was a duplication of the binding if the
	symbol was already defined in the out most environment. Since the
	new binding was placed before the older one, good value was
	found. However, it makes environment bigger than necessary
	(and strange result when using environment->list).

	* Src/env.c (value_in_env): New function. It returns the value of
	var in given env. Search is done only at out most level. This
	function is an utility function for local "define".

Mon Dec 19 12:08:31 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/stk.h (MAX_CHAR_CODE): Correct value is 255 (it was 256)

Fri Dec 16 16:06:57 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* STk 2.1.5 release

Fri Dec 16 13:56:25 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/dynload.c: Adding support for HPUX (thanks to ipankar Gupta
	<dg@hplb.hpl.hp.com>)


Fri Dec  9 22:15:34 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* Snow/run-snow.in: There is now a new interpreter, called snow
	(for Scheme NO Window), which is the STk interpreter without Tk
	support.  This interpreter is an independant executable. It can be
	called with the snow shell-script or by unsetting the DISPLAY
	variable.

Thu Dec  8 22:47:44 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* Makefile.in: Modifications of all configure.in and Makefile.in. 
	Now we can 
		- share versions of STk between different architectures
		- have several versions of STk installed on the same machine

Wed Dec  7 21:46:44 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* Src/dynload.c (load_object_file): Adding dynamic loading support
	for NetBSD-1.0 (i386-port). Thanks to Franke Ruediger
	(Ruediger.Franke@rz.tu-ilmenau.de) for the patch.

Tue Dec  6 00:26:48 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* Src/tk-glue.c (execute_Tk_lib_cmd): GC bug correction. There was a
	bug when a GC occured during the creation of the argv array of a Tk
	command. This bug occured on Linux with -O2; Correcting it doesn't arrange
	things==> Usage of an equivalent code. Thanks to H. Stein for signaling this bug.


Sat Nov 26 10:46:58 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* Src/stklos.c: Changing all the "class" variables by "clath" for
	C++ users

	* Src/port.c (loadfile): All the code for loading file is now
	written in C and things are more "orthogonal".  New variable
	defined: *load-suffixes*.

	* Src/toplevel.c (repl_driver): Move of user init initialisation
	so taht they are taken into account in case of a "stk -f" (thanks
	to Brian Webb webbb@aies.tucson.saic.com)

Wed Nov  9 13:54:34 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* STk-2.1.4 release

Thu Nov  3 23:20:06 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* A New datatype: regular expressions. They are defined in a
	dynamic loadable file (for the regexp compiler and the apply
	function) and in a Scheme file
	(mainly for the regexp-replace[-all] procedures

Wed Nov  2 16:49:07 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* file-is-xxx? and file-exists? are now written in C

	* Elimination of %file and %string Tcl command. Those commands
	were used behind the scene to avoid some rewriting. No code in the
	distribution should use them.  This conduct to the defineition of
	two new primitives string-index and file-is-executable? (which was
	forgotten in previous releases).

Mon Oct 31 11:04:27 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* Src/hash.c (hash_table_stats): Circumvent a bug in Tcl code on
	empty hash tables (see comment in source file)

Fri Oct 28 14:23:36 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* STklos/Tk/Toplevel.stk (<Toplevel>): All the "wm" Tk-command
	options are now available through Toplevel slot accesses (Idea
	from Rob Deline) A New global variable: *top-root*: This is a
	toplevel which contains the *root* window. Changing the name of
	the root window can now be done by
	    (set! (title *top-root*) "New title")

Tue Oct 18 14:42:55 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/number.c (lround): Rewritten to avoid the use of the rint(3)
	function which does'nt seems to exist on some systems (SCO and
	some HP at least)

Mon Oct 17 18:29:31 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* Lib/editor.stk (stk:all-fonts): Various font specifications
	changes (those which where used in all the Lib directory where not
	portable.

Mon Oct 17 11:38:17 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/slib.c (lrandom): Bug correction (bignum where not allowed
	  as parameter => (random(random 10)) was invalid since result of
	  random is always a bignum
	  (bug signaled by  Markus Armbruster <armbru@pond.sub.org>)

Fri Oct 14 09:02:12 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* New procedure: run-process which permit to run a process with
	 redirection off the stdin, stdout and stderr. The code is a
	 rewriting of the Alexander Taranov, Grygory Niconov and David
	 Tolpin contribution.

Thu Oct 13 14:56:05 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/number.c: Add a rint compatible function for systems which
	desn't provide one (SCO apparently -- signaled by
	markd@grizzly.com)

Wed Oct 12 15:12:51 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* New functions for port manipulation (port->string
	  port->string-list ....)  With those function, it is easy to
	  write a Tcl-like exec.  All those function are written in
	  Scheme.

Tue Oct 11 15:53:49 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/slib.c (set_random_seed): modified to allow bignums for the seed.

Mon Oct 10 14:16:52 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Minor modifications to allow a better compilation on some C and C++
	compilers.

Sun Oct  9 18:19:01 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* Bug correction: the eval_stack (which serves ONLY for displaying
	context upon error was not corectly managed on "tail recursion
	elimination". This leads to memory consumption on infinites loops.

Tue Sep 27 11:46:01 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* STklos/tk-classes.stk: Creation of a new file which define a set
	of autoloads. Those autoload permits to avoid to use a long list
	of require at the beginning of programs

	* Src/port.c (do_autoload): Adding support for autoload in C. Now,
	any kind of symbol can be autoloaded.

Thu Sep 15 16:36:01 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* 2.1.3 Release

Wed Sep 14 18:52:14 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/stklos.c (make_instance): GC bug correction in a critical
	section of code.

	* Src/macros.c (lmacro): GC bug correction in a critical section
	of code.

	* Src/symbol.c (intern): modification of a critical section of
	code a GC could occur between the hash table entry creation and
	the end of its initialization. Correction of the same kind of
	problem in keyword.c.  Bug discovered by Rob Deline.

	* Src/stklos.c (modify_instance): Bug correction (change-class
	make a twist between old and new instance) ==> following GC free
	the bad instance data !!

Fri Sep  9 13:40:12 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Packing of the STk2.1.2 release

Thu Sep  8 09:27:16 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* STklos/stklos.c: Definition of a slot_set_if_unbound which only
	affect a slot if needed. This function is used in the slots
	initialization process.  Now, things are corrects when a slot
	:initform is overloaded by inheritance or when initialization is
	done in an initialize followed by a next-method
	(i.e. it's the user value which is taken instead of the default one).

	* Src/gc.h: re-integretate gc_protect (can be useful for extension
	writers)

	* After 3 days continuations are tail recursive..... I thought I
	will become crazy before I found the little typing mistake (a
	lsubr instaed of a tsubr in primitives.c) which makes things
	weird.

Mon Sep  5 18:37:16 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Symbols and keywords use now Tcl Hash table (which grow
	dynamically).  Keywords share now memory. This reduces drastically
	space occupation. (Old symbol table uses conses, and keywords
	where not shared). Unused symbols can be GCed now.

	* Change class bug correction (Thanks to Rob Deline).

	* -image can be specified needs not anymore to be the first
	argument of the command line.

	* Src/argv.c: "-cells" can be specified when calling stk. This
	give the amount of cells created upon init.

	* Src/argv.h (save_unix_args_and_environment): moved to
	argv.c. This new file contains all the argc/argv/env stuff. STk
	doesn't rely anymore on Tk code for parsing command line
	arguments. This permits to have a arguments processing even if not
	compiled with -DUSE_TK.

	* Tk/tkArgv.c (Tk_ParseArgv): 

	* Src/gc.c (init_gc): GC complete revision: Now we have a set of
	heaps and a new heap is allocated as soon as the global space is
	"nearly" filled (I have fixed nearly to 75%). User can maually
	grow the heap by using extend-heap.  There are time statitics now
	indicating how much time is spent in GC.

	* Src/cont.c (throw): bug correction in
	continuations. Specifically, the gc_mark phase for the
	continuation blocks may fail because the stack starting and ending
	addresses used in the code are both (char *), not (SCM *),
	aligned, and the stack is copied in bytes, not in SCMs.  on char *
	rather than SCM. This bug was discoverred by Felix Wu
	(wu@cadence.com)

	* Adding SLIB support (i.e. I have written the STk.init
	file). Some modifications in stk.init were needed (accepting the
	".scm" suffix mainly)

	* Src/macros.c (expand): Cleanup in macros. We have now
	macro-expand and macro-expand-1

Thu Aug 25 15:59:33 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/number.c (do_integer_division): bug correction for
	modulo. The fix is due to kerch@parc.xerox.com.

Wed Aug 24 12:02:41 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/number.c (integerp): Bug correction. integer? must returns
	#t even if the value is an inexact integer.

	* port.c: - modification to allow close-port on string-port 
	          - if the first char of a filename is a pipe ("|") character,
		  usage of popen instead of fopen. This permits to define
		  "pipe ports" very easily as in Tcl.

	* Integration of the Suresh Srinivas STk-wtour demo to the
	Contrib. Some minor bugs have been fixed and some new lessons have
	been added. Hierarchy was modified to fit to the contrib
	directory.

	* Definition of a file compatibility file which assume compatibily
	among versions. When this file is loaded, a message will be
	printed, saying that you have to upgrade your source.

	* Adding support for Text in STklos Definition of a new version of
	the STF format (0.2) which permits to load and save files with
	their enhancment (font, color, ...). Now, tags can be dynamically
	created (instead of choosen in a fixed list).  A compatibility
	mode is provided (see above)
