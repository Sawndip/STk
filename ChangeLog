1998-06-09  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Release 3.99.2

1998-06-03  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/port.c (STk_read_line): Iconcorrect behaviour when a file is
 	not ended by a newline (thanks to Shiro Kawai
 	<shiro@sqush.squareusa.com>)
	
1998-06-02  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Tcl/tcl.h: Added a dumb field to the Tcl_Obj type for AIX cc
	compiler (thanks to Eric Fintzel <tpfintz@fr.ibm.com>)

	* Src/dynload.c : Added fake functions STk_call_external,
 	STk_external_existsp and STk_cstring2string for systems without
 	dynamic loading. Patch proposed by Eric Fintzel <tpfintz@fr.ibm.com>
	and Ron Lawrence <lawrence@chrysalis.com>.

	* Extensions/stk-genmake.in: File added. This script file can be
 	used to build a Makefile for extensions. It constructs a Makefile
 	which uses exactly the same options and compiler that was used to
 	build the interpreter.

	* Extensions/%README: Updated.

1998-06-01  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STklos/Tk/Basics.stklos: Added exportations of <Tk-object> and
 	tk-constructor.

	* STklos/Tk/Tk-meta.stklos: Added exportation of
 	compute-tk-virtual-get-n-set.

1998-05-31  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STklos/stklos.stk (ensure-class): Better error message when a
 	slot or a metaclass is duplicated (the duplicate is now clearly shown
	now).  

	* configure.in: Added the -fpic option for Linux shared libraries.
  	It seems that problems appear when the object file is bigger than
 	64Kb (at least the Tktable is is in this case).

1998-05-30  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Doc/Reference/*.tex : Documentation update

	* Src/port.c (internal_format): Added the ~W format

	* Src/print.c: heavy rewritting. should be a little bit more
 	efficient.
	
1998-05-28  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Extensions/html.c (html_next_token): Partly rewritten to take
 	into account the syntax "&#number;" (signalled by Jacques
 	Chazarain).  BTW, the procedure has now the same behaviour as
 	Netscape for unfinished entity (e.g. x&zz<...> is seen as a string
 	which must not be interpretated).
	

1998-05-25  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/read.c: Now we can read circular data such as the ones
	built by write*

1998-05-22  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STklos/Tk/Tk-classes.stklos: Added <Tk-composite-toplevel> to
	Tk-classes.

1998-05-21  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Tk/unix/tkUnixSend.c (Tk_SetAppName): Change the names of
 	mutiple applications from "STk #2", "STk #3", ... to "STk#2",
 	"STk#3" to avoid problems with the (winfo 'interps) call.
	This is clearly a hack.

1998-05-19  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Extensions/process.c: Correction of a bug that prevents you from
 	getting the exit status of a child process under certain
 	circumstances. Patch provided by Grant Edwards
 	<grante@reddwarf.frco.com>

	* Src/tcl-glue.c (STk_tcl_getvar): forgot a return in the function 
	which breaks result at least on Solaris (thanks to Thomas Buerger
	for the patch).

	* STklos/stklos.stk (compute-get-n-set): Added the :each-subclass
 	allocation scheme which correspond to the 3.1.1 :class allocation.
  	Change was requested by Thomas Buerger
 	<buerger@serv1.iaa.tu-clausthal.de>

1998-05-15  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Lib/trace.stk: Bug correction: traces of primitives was incorrect.

1998-05-14  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Lib/init.stk:
	* Src/toplevel.c: New global variable *last-defined* which is set
	when a define is done. This allow some traces when evaluating 
	large pieces of code.

1998-05-11  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Lib/tk-init.stk : functions of image.stk are now autoload

1998-04-30  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STk-3.99.1 Release

	* STklos/stklos.stk (ensure-class): Inclusion of the Metaclass 
	init-keywords patch from J-M kubek <kubek@insa-tlse.fr>, which 
	allows to initialize some slots of a class when declaring it.

	* Lib/bigloo.stk (module): The compatibility function between
 	bigloo modules and STk modules was not updated to the current
 	version of modules. Bug signaled by J-M kubek <kubek@insa-tlse.fr>

	* STklos/stklos.stk (shallow-clone): usage of
 	class-definition-name instead of slot-definition-name in *-clone
 	functions. Bug signaled by Walter C. Pelissero
 	<wcp@luppolo.lpds.sublink.org>

	* Tcl/tclUnixPort.h: 
	* Tcl/Int.h: Path correction for accessing compatibility
 	files. This was needed for SunOS 4.3.x.

	* Extensions/Makefile.in : Don't trap errors when linking to see
	that there are problems (particularly for Solaris).

1998-04-27  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Installation process has been updated.

	* STklos/Tk/Button.stklos: The variable associated to a radio
 	button or check button was not using the environment.

	* STklos/Tk/Text.stklos:
	* STklos/Tk/Entry.stklos:
	* STklos/Tk/Scale.stklos:
	* STklos/Tk/Basic.stklos: New function: initialize-value-slot
 	which allow to initialize this slot even if the state of the
 	widget is disabled. Idea from Walter C. Pelissero
 	<wcp@luppolo.lpds.sublink.org>
	

1998-04-26  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/toplevel.c: Correction of a long standing bug which causes
 	background STk to take all the CPU in some circumstances. It was
 	hard to track

1998-04-22  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/tcl-glue.c (STk_valid_environment): Various problems
 	corrected with the new :environment options which is available on
 	widgets now.

	* Src/port.c (STk_flush): Bug correction. Trying to flush a string
 	port was erroneous. Bug signalled by Walter C. Pelissero
 	<wcp@luppolo.lpds.sublink.org>

Mon Apr 20 20:52:21 1998  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Doc/Manual/repl-display-prompt.n: New documentation file.

	* Doc/Reference/*: Documentation update.

Mon Apr 13 12:24:19 1998  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Demos/Html-demos/*: Adding the English demos which were
 	accidentally forgotten from the previous release


Sun Apr 12 14:13:05 1998  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Help/*: Pages were not regenerated and correspond to an old
 	version.

	* configure.in : Various correction in the installation process
 	which was wrong. The spec file for RPM and the STk.prj are now
 	auto generated at configuration time

Fri Apr 10 09:01:17 1998  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STk-3.99.0 release

Wed Apr  8 17:02:26 1998  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/*.c: Correction: stderr (instead of STk_stderr) was
 	incorrectly used in some places.
	
	* Src/Stack: Code was absolutely incorrect for machine which don't
 	support FFI.

Sun Mar 22 15:05:47 1998  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STk/port.c: load accepts now (again) a module as optionnal
 	parameter

Mon Mar  9 21:42:08 1998  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Lib/www-html.stk: Code for applet in S-scape polished.

	* Src/tcl-glue: Bug correction in STk_valid_environment

	* Tcl/tclEvent.c: Bug correction: after events callback table was 
	not correctly cleaned when an event was fired.	

Sun Mar  8 23:41:11 1998  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/cont.c: Addition of R5RS values

Sun Mar  1 11:53:40 1998  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Lib/www*: The Web Browser has been rewriten.

Sat Feb 28 12:37:29 1998  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/gc.c: Bug correction: Error context was improperly reset
 	when an error occurs in catch.

Fri Feb 27 01:07:50 1998  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/unix.c: Three new functions on file: remove-file,
 	rename-file temporary-file-name. They correspond to their
 	equivalent in the ANSI C norm.

Tue Feb 24 18:56:17 1998  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Demos/Widget/*.stklos: All the widget demo are now implemented.

	* STklos/Tk/Text.stklos: New <Tk-Text-inset>. This class is the
 	now the parent class of <Text-window> and of (the new) class
 	<Text-image>.

	* Tk/generic/tkConfig.c: a lot of change to take image as a real 
	type (instead of a string). Configuration has been cleaned. 

Thu Feb 19 16:39:46 1998  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Demos/stetris.stk (new-game): replaced an after which use a pre
 	STk-3.0 after bindind (i.e. an after with a list) by a
 	lambda. This cause problem with module environment (the first one
 	I see since a long time).  This could have been resolved by
 	makeing Tk importing STklos+Tk. But there is no good reason to do
 	so. The bad news is that very old code can be broken if it uses
 	list bindings instead of lambda (it's more than 2 years than this
 	form is deprecated) and STklos. 

Thu Feb 12 16:17:36 1998  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Demos/stklos-widgets.stklos: Updated to take into account new
 	composite widgets.

	* Src/port.c: read-line now skips the '\r' characters.

Sun Feb  8 20:59:34 1998  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Tk/generic/tkScale.c (ScaleVarProc): New option :ENVIRONMENT
	* Tk/generic/tkMessage.c (ConfigureMessage): New option :ENVIRONMENT

	* Src/error.c: Cleanup (one more time :-<)

Mon Feb  2 22:47:52 1998  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STklos/Tk/Composite/Colorbox.stklos: 	New class <Color-box>, and its
	user function Tk:choose-color.


Sun Feb  1 19:16:46 1998  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Lib/tk-unix.stk: New file for the definition of standard messages
	box. They are simulated on Unix and will be natve (someday) on Windows.

	
	* STklos/Tk/MsgBox.stklos: New Classes: <Tk-message-box> 
 	<Abort-retry-ignore-message-box>  <Ok-message-box> 
	<Ok-cancel-message-box>  <Ok-cancel-message-box> 
	<Retry-cancel-message-box> <Yes-no-message-box> 
	<Yes-no-cancel-message-box>. This classes are used by the 
	new function Tk:message-box to build mesages boxes.
		
	* Src/read.c: Now #. is evaluated in the current module (instead
 	of the global one).  

	* Src/tcl-glue.c (STk_convert_Tcl_string2list): current module is
 	set to the Tk module when converting a Tk result to Scheme. This
 	is mainly for "#." expression which must be evaluated in the Tk
 	module since all the side effects done by Tk are done in it.


Thu Jan 29 19:21:48 1998  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STklos/Tk/Composite/Choicebox.stklos: New slot for
 	<Choice-box>es: CHOICE. This slot contains the set of possible
	values for the entry.
	

Mon Jan 26 15:42:11 1998  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STklos/Tk/Tk-meta.stklos: Protocol for widget has been
 	"lighted".  The slot tk-valid-option has ben deleted and slot are
 	set one by one after class initialization. This in in fact faster
 	than the old method. However <Frame> and <Toplevel> classes, don't 
	fit well in this scheme (some of their slots cannot be changed 
	after the widget is created (e.g. class or visual) => There is a 
	spcial init function for theses classes.

	* STklos/Tk/Basics.stklos: Composite widgets have now a class
 	slots which contains the class of the object. This slot is
 	initialized by default to "Composite", but it can be overloaded
 	for a particular class. For instance labeled entries use the value
 	"LabeledEntry" by default. This feature can be used for
 	initializing the X11 resource database. for instance you can have
	
		STk*LabeledEntry*Entry*Background: white

	in the .Xdefaults file to set the default value of background of
 	the entry of a <Labeled-entry> widget.
	
	* STklos/Tk/Basics.stklos: :tk-virtual slots accept now the
 	:init-form option. That means that you can do new classes which
 	simply change the default value by subclassing a previous widget
 	class.

	* STklos/Tk/Frame.stklos: Change in the STklos hierarchy:
	<Toplevel> inherits now from <Frame>. They were separate classes
	before.

Sun Jan 25 10:53:54 1998  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/toplevel.c:
	* Lib/init.stk: User initialization file (.stkrc) is now loaded
 	after Tk is initialized. It used to be initialized at the end of
	init.stk (and hence just before Tk). File loading is done in C. 
	now.

Sat Jan 24 13:22:51 1998  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STklos/stklos.stk: Bug correction in METHOD.

	* STklos/describe.stk: renamed to STklos/describe.stklos
	* STklos/active.stk: renamed to STklos/active.stklos

Thu Jan 22 23:50:38 1998  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Lib/init.stk: New macro: DEFINE-VARIABLE. It's equivalent to the
 	Elisp/CL DEFVAR
	
	* Lib/tk-init.stk (*start-withdrawn*): A lot of people dislike the
 	fact that the root window is mapped on screen when Tk is started,
 	The code below, unmaps the *root* window and make it appearing as
 	soon as the first sub-window is packed or some action is asked to
 	the window manager for *root*. With this code, the the behaviour
 	is identical to the Tk original one except that the empty squared
 	window don't appears on screen. The original behaviour can be
 	recovered by setting *start-withdrawn* to #f

Tue Jan 20 14:40:31 1998  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/proc.c: New undoumented procedure: %procedure-arity
	
	* STklos/stklos.stk: 
	* Src/stklos.c: Optimisation of slot accesses for virtual
 	slots. The call to APPLY is now inlined in the slot-ref and
 	slot-set! functions. The arity of the setter and getter functions
 	is now verified at class creation (rather than slot access, in
 	some extent).  The only drawback is that the getter and setter
 	function must be closures now, whereas they could be generic
 	funtions or primitives before (but I cannot imagine how it could
 	be used).

Sun Jan 18 20:06:00 1998  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STklos/trace-gf.stklos: New file for tracing generic functions.
	* Lib/trace.stk: Trace has been updated and take into account
 	generic functions now.

Tue Jan 13 10:13:22 1998  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Lib/dialog.stk: Correction of bug signaled by Fritz
 	Heinrichmeyer <fritz.heinrichmeyer@fernuni-hagen.de>

Fri Jan  9 21:06:22 1998  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/port.c: Bug correction in "AUTOLOAD?". BTW, this function
 	admit now a (optional) second parameter which can be a module.

	* Src/syntax.c: 
	* Src/env.c: 
	* Src/module.c: Bug correction for C varaiables which were
 	"disconnected" of their C counterpart in some cases

Thu Jan  8 12:27:44 1998  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/stklos.c: New slot for generic functions: "module"

Sat Jan  3 16:50:55 1998  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STk.prj: STk.prj has been completely redefined. Now PRCS
 	versions are in sync with STk version. 

Thu Jan  1 13:18:22 1998  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/dynload.c: New function: EXTERNAL-EXISTS? to determine if a
 	symbol is defined in a library.

Wed Dec 31 15:37:36 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/hash.c (hash_table_put) Bug correction: code was not GC
 	safe. Thanks to Sarah Calvo <sarah@grammatech.com>

Tue Dec 30 23:33:09 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Extensions/posix.c: Integration of several new functions given
 	by Shiro Kawai <shiro@sqush.squareusa.com>

	* Src/argv.c: The way arguments are processed has been changed:
 	now the first argument is taken as a script name (unless there was
 	already a -file option specified).  Furthermore, when the -file
 	option is used (implicitly or explicitly), the variable
 	*program-name* is set to the name of the script file (instead of
 	the file name of the interpreter).

	* Doc/Manual/stk.1: Adaptation of the man page for the new
 	conventions for argument passing to the interpreter (-file option
 	and implicit -file).

	* Src/eval.c: 
	* Src/error.c: Bug correction: In some circumstances a buggy
 	REPORT-ERROR can lead to an infinite loop. Now we can have the
 	stack when in report-error AND the original error which caused the
 	execution of the report-error procedure.

Sun Dec 28 21:44:01 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Lib/Match/normalize.scm:
	* Lib/Match/compiler.scm:
	* Lib/Match/descr.scm: Adaptation for STk.


Mon Dec 22 00:00:54 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Doc/Reference/Appendix.tex: New Appendix which describes the
 	main differences between STk versions.

	* Src/extend.c: POINTER->STRING has been moved to file dynload.c
 	and renamed C-STRING->STRING since ita accepts pointers AND
 	strings now.

Mon Dec 15 13:53:46 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/print.c: Cosmetic change: When a procedure is writen, it
 	displays its argument list. This is helpful when debugging

	* Src/number.c: Two new function for dealing with unsigned C
 	numbers: long STk_integer2long(SCM x); unsigned long
 	STk_integer2ulong(SCM x);

	* Src/extend.c: New primitive C-POINTER->STRING. This procedure
 	converts a C-pointer to a string.  An optionnal length can be
 	given.

Sat Dec 13 11:07:46 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/stklos.c: 
	* Src/slib.c:
	* Src/port.c: 
	* Src/gc.c: Correction of various bugs signalled by Walter C. Pelissero
 	<wcp@luppolo.lpds.sublink.org>

	* Src/syntax.c: Bug correction in definition of internal variables

Wed Dec 10 23:25:21 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/signal.c (handle_sigsegv_signal): new procedure. This
 	procedure is called when a SIGSEGV is called. This avoid an
 	infinite loop when a real SIGSEGV occurs. It just go to the
 	toplevel (if the signal has not been redirected)

Sun Dec  7 22:01:54 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* configure.in: Take into account the new libc (Gnu libc) for
 	Linux.

Wed Nov 19 09:34:22 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Cleaning code of environment allocation. There is now a new type
 	for frame cells (tc_frame). For now this type is equivalent to a
 	cons, but it allows future optimization on environment allocation.

Thu Nov 13 01:10:41 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/proc.c:
	* Src/gc.c:
	* Src/eval.c:
	* Src/syntax.c: Cleaning of procedure creation code. All 
	closures are created by the function STk_makeclosure 
	(instead of being inlined in code).
	
	* Src/syntax.c: 
	* Src/env.c: Correction of a long standing bug with internal
 	defines management.  In some cases, access to local variable could
 	be false. This was because new variables were inserted at the
 	beginning of the environment instead of the end.

	* Extensions/process.c (free_process): Standard ports were freed
 	instead of closed when a process was deallocated. Bug discovered
 	by Sarah Calvo <sarah@grammatech.com>

	
Wed Nov 12 09:35:13 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/list.c: new primitve: the R3RS last-pair

Sun Nov  9 22:01:56 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/list.c: 
	* Src/primitives.c: New primitive: append!

Tue Oct 28 21:24:02 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Lib/match.stk: Integration of the Bigloo MATCH-CASE and MATCH-LAMBDA
	primitives

Tue Oct  7 09:46:46 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Extensions/posix.c (posix_stat2vector): bug correction (GC
 	problems)

	* Src/proc.c (STk_for_each): minor bug correction: return an
 	undefined result instead of NIL as before.

	* Lib/posix.stk: Two new functions POSIX-STAT->LIST and
 	POSIX-LSTAT which make easier the use of stat function (they
 	return a keyworded list instead of a (cryptic) vector.

Wed Sep 17 15:39:54 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Lib/tk-init.stk: New variable *image-path* which contains path
	for loading images.

Tue Sep 16 16:29:51 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/tcl-lib.c (Tcl_OpenFileChannel): build an error message when
 	file cannot be opened.  This is now done in Tcl. Note that the
 	Tk8.0 code is not consistent here since it exists places where the
 	check against NULL is done and other where it is supposed that Tcl
 	fill the error message!!!!

Sun Sep 14 11:22:48 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STklos/Tk/Basics.stklos: New metaclass:
 	<Tk-composite-toplevel>. This is identical to the class
 	<Tk-composite-widget>, except that the widhet lives in its own
 	toplevel window. Furthermore, this widget has a slot called TITLE
 	which contains the title of the widget window.

	*STklos/Tk/*.stklos: added a "(select-module Tk) in all these files	
	
Sat Sep  6 22:07:39 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/toplevel.c: names of display-prompt and display-result have
 	been changed to repl-display-prompt and repl-display-result

Wed Sep  3 18:18:45 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STklos/Tk/Basics.stklos:
	* STklos/Tk/Button.stklos:
	* STklos/Tk/Menu.stklos: Addition of new Tk8.0 slots

Fri Aug 29 12:17:58 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Lib/tearoff.stk: File deleted. It is now included in menu.stk

Wed Aug 27 15:46:25 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Mp/Makefile: Path was incorrect when using fgmp.

	* Src/stklos.c: 
	* Src/tk-main.c: Gc_protect is no more useful on modules since a
 	module is always accessible from the module table.

	* Src/tcl-lib.c: Simulation of the new function
 	"Tcl_DeleteCommandFromToken" used by the final Tk8.0

Mon Aug 25 12:27:11 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Start of port for final Tk8.0.
	
	* Src/module.c:
	* Src/primitives.c: Modules are now stored in a private table
 	instead of bound in the global space. The new primitive
 	FIND-MODULE queries the module table to find a given module
 	(modules are still first-class objects).
	
	* Tk/generic/tkWindow.c: Reverted the command "tk-state" to "tk"
 	since the module names are no more bound in global space.

Sun Aug 24 17:10:00 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/module.c: There is now a module which is created when the
 	interpreter is initialized.  This module (named Scheme) exports
 	all initial bindings (mainly primitives) defined when the
 	interpreter starts.  So, even when the user overload a standard
 	primitive, the initial bindings can be found in the Scheme module.


Wed Aug 20 14:02:06 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Doc/Makefile: Installation of manual pages even if the
 	documentation is not requested.

Mon Aug 18 11:50:32 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Doc/Manual/label.n:
	* Doc/Manual/grid.n:
	* Doc/Manual/frame.n:
	* Doc/Manual/font.n:
	* Doc/Manual/event.n:
	* Doc/Manual/entry.n:
	* Doc/Manual/destroy.n:
	* Doc/Manual/checkbutton.n:
	* Doc/Manual/button.n:
	* Doc/Manual/canvas.n:
	* Doc/Manual/bind.n:
	* Doc/Manual/bindtags.n: Documentation update for Tk8.0

Sun Aug 17 23:47:09 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STklos/Tk/Basics.stklos: New class <Tk-environment> for the
 	widget which have a "text-variable" or "variable" slot (Button,
 	Checkbutton, Entry, ...)  The corresponding widget have been
 	changed to take into account this new class.

Sat Aug 16 16:28:55 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Tk/generic/tkButton.c: Buttons, Checkbuttons and Radiobuttons
 	can use a :variable and :textvariable in a given environment. This
 	environment is given with the new :environment option.

Wed Aug 13 17:21:08 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/error.c: The variables *last-error-message* and
 	*last-error-arg* are set hen an error occurs. This is useful to
 	find what error occured when errors are catched. This is also
 	needed by Envdraw.

Tue Jul  8 10:00:26 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* New type in the interpreter: tc_tclobjet. This type is necessary
	to simulate the Tcl "Tcl_Obj" type. Tcl_Obj is a crazy thing. 
	Why Tcl does not use a GC, and life would be a *lot* easier (for me
	but for them too...)

Mon Jul  7 09:59:49 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Start of Tk8.0 integration

Mon Jun 23 19:43:36 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STklos/stklos.stk (class-subclasses): rewritten. It was too slow.

Sun Jun  1 11:20:21 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STklos/stklos.stk: (Tk-)virtual slots can now have an
 	:initform option.

Fri May 23 16:07:01 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/stklos.c (build_initializers): build_initializers takes now
 	one more parameter (the environment in which the class has been
 	defined) Consequently, initializer are evaluated in the lexical
 	environment of the class definition.	

	* STklos/stklos.stk (compute-get-n-set): Standard behavior of class
	slots is now identical to CLOS: when a class-slot is inherited, it 
	is shared with instances of the superclass. If it is redefined, 
	a new slot is created

Thu May 15 18:04:50 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Lib/inspect-*.stk: Adaptation of the old inspector for the
 	STk-3.x release. This is incomplete but it can be use until the
 	Rigth Thing is finished. All the adaptation was done by Brian
 	Denheyer <briand@northwest.com>. Thanks to him.

	* Src/proc.c (general_map): map was buggy with a null list of
 	argument (map +) gave a core dump!

Thu May  8 11:28:11 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/port.c: Go back: LOAD and TRY-LOAD don't use anymore the
 	environment parameter.  In fact loading a file is done in the
 	current module now rather at the global level as before.

	* Tcl/tclUtil.c (Tcl_DStringStartSublist, Tcl_DStringEndSublist):
 	braces replaced by parentheses (bug signaled by Vincent Granet
 	<vg@unice.fr>)

Sun Apr  6 15:07:20 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/port.c: File loading: LOAD and TRY-LOAD accept now an
	  optional second argument. This argument must be an environment
 	  which states in which environment the file must be loaded.

Fri Apr  4 14:49:15 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Lib/error.stk: Minor fix in the layout of display environment
 	windows.

Thu Mar 27 15:32:28 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/toplevel.c (repl_loop): The interactive prompt is no more a
	  constant. In fact, when the prompt must be displayed, we try to
	  apply the thunk contained in the *prompt* global symbol (*prompt*
	  must be a thunk). If an error occurs during this application, the
	  usual "STk> " prompt is displayed.

	* Lib/init.stk: Adding a default *prompt* closure in the startup file

Sun Mar 23 19:57:07 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/toplevel.c (repl_driver): in the toplevel repl, the result is
	  not displayed if we are not in interactive mode (suggested by a mail
	  from Jesse Schell <jns@ishmael>)

Fri Mar 14 14:00:51 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/list.c (STk_append2): The old private append2 is now public
	  since it is often used in the interpreter. Part of it using
	  STk_append have been modified.

Fri Feb 28 10:43:41 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/read.c: New feature: multi lines comments 
	  (as in Common Lisp: #| ... |# )

	* Src/stklos.c (STk_init_STklos): New MOP procedures
		generic-function-name
		generic-function-methods
		method-generic-function
		method-specializers
		method-procedure
		remove-method
		change-object-class

Sun Feb 23 23:08:40 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STklos/stklos.stk: New MOP procedures
		slot-definition-name
		slot-definition-options	
		slot-definition-allocation
		slot-definition-getter
		slot-definition-setter
		slot-definition-accessor

	* Src/stklos.c: Instances type is now in the cell. This decreases 
	globally the size of a STklos instance of the size of one int.

	* Two new classes: <simple-method> and <accessor-method>. 
	A <simple-method> is a method which cannot be call next_method.
	<Accesor-method>s are used for defining slot-readers and writers.
	Application of these methods are faster than normal method
	since the next-method object is not constructed.

Mon Jan 20 15:59:24 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STklos/stklos.stk (object-equal?): has been redefined to call
	  eqv? rather than returning #f. This is the same thing except that
	  when you redefine eqv?, it automatically redefine equal?. 
	  Furthermore, it is more coherent with standard Scheme eqv? and equal?

Sat Jan  4 00:45:37 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STklos/describe.stk: New DESCRIBE method for generic functions.
	  Modification of DESCRIBE method for classes to take into account new
	  class slots (specializers and initializers are no more displayed)

	* Src/stklos.c: 
	  STklos/stklos.stk:
	  Modifications
	     - when a slot does not exists, the gf slot-missing is called
	     - when a unbound slot is read, the gf slot-unbound is called
	  New primitives
	     - slot-ref-using-class
	     - slot-set-using-class
	     - slot-bound-using-class?
	     - slot-exists-using-class?

	* STklos/stklos.stk (change-class): change-class didn't 
	initialize the slots added to the instance. This is done
	now (but this is a little bit different from CLOS: unbound
	slots in the "old" instances are initialized with the initform 
	value in the "new" instance, whereas they remain unbound
	in CLOS).	

Wed Jan  1 11:44:45 1997  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/toplevel.c: Modification of copyright dates (we are (just) in
	  1997 now).

Mon Dec 30 10:08:19 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STklos/stklos.stk: STklos does not need hash table anymore.

Sun Dec 29 22:24:24 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/port.c (STk_autoloadp): Bug correction.

Mon Dec 23 12:05:35 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/io.c: old trace deleted

	* Src/extend.h:
	* Src/extend.c: Now, extended types are entered in the class
	  hierarchy; When you define a new type, such as hash-table, a new
	  class is defined. This class has a name which is built by adding
	  brackets (<>) around the type name; this class always inherits from
	  <object> (that means that it is not possible to make fancy
	  inheritance schemes with the current solution, which would have been
	  too difficult to take into account with dynamic loading precedence
	  problems).

Sun Dec 15 11:04:10 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/list.c: member: bug correction on circular lists
	* Src/list.c: New list functions: remq, remv, remove.

Sun Dec  8 10:13:30 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STklos/Tk/Toplevel.stklos:
	* STklos/Tk/Tk-methods.stklos: 
	* STklos/Tk/Tk-classes.stklos:
	* STklos/Tk/Basics.stklos: Bug correction: Toplevel.stklos could be
	  sometimes loaded several times.  Toplevel is now loaded when doing a
	  (require "Tk-classes").

Thu Nov 14 22:17:58 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Tk/generic/tkConfig.c (Tk_ConfigureInfo): Bug correction for gadgets
	  with only 1 option (such as separator in menus)

	* Demos/amib.stklos: Bug correction in code generation. It was
	  possible to use a non yet defined widget in the ":in" option for
	  "place" or "pack".

Sat Nov  9 15:17:06 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STklos/Tk/Composite/Scrolltext.stklos: 
	* STklos/Tk/Composite/Scrollcanvas.stklos:
	* STklos/Tk/Composite/Scrollbox.stklos: Scrollbars are now managed by
	  grid.

Wed Nov  6 00:15:42 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Tk4.2 integration. 

Sun Nov  3 18:53:57 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Lib/www-browser.stklos: A new Web browser package.

	* Demos/webrowse.stklos: This demo replaces the hbrowse demo 
	  
	
Wed Oct 30 16:19:46 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Extensions/pixmap.c: upgrading pixmap package to the Tix 4.1b1

Tue Oct 29 00:54:05 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Lib/www*.stk: New files for WEB browsing. Distant images and
	files are now correctly handled. A lot of ideas have been taken 
	from the Harvey L. Stein WWW package.

Wed Oct 23 16:53:19 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Demos/stklos-widgets.stklos: New demo which replaces compo-demo
	since it contains demo for widgets which are not composite.

	* STklos/Tk/Widget/Balloon.stklos: new widget written in STklos

	* Lib/focus.stk:
	* Lib/tk-init.stk: binding for <Tab> and <Shift-Tab> are now set in
	  tk-init.stk to avoid problems when this default binding must be
	  overloaded by user.  Bug signalled by Harvey J. Stein
	  <abel@netvision.net.il>

Mon Oct 21 12:29:07 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STklos/active.stk: a new metaclass which provides actives slots.
	  Actives slots are slots to which a function can be associated 
 	  before/after reading/setting its value. The allocation is :active
	  and functions can be set with :before-slot-ref, :after-slot-ref
	  before-slot-set! or after-slot-set!.

	* STklos/Tk/Widget/Gauge: Two new widgets written in Scheme:
	  <Gauge> and <Valued-Gauge>. They use the active slots metaclass.	  

Thu Oct 17 14:50:29 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Tk/generic/tkText.c: Modified "text dumping". It yields now a
	  correct Scheme list.  The :command option is not corrected correctly
	  for now.

Mon Oct 14 10:22:37 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Extensions/socket.c: Correction of a bug in socket_shutdown (when GC
	  occurs)

Fri Oct 11 13:02:55 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Extensions/socket.c (socket_shutdown): Bug correction in shutdown
	  (shutdown and close where inverted).

	* Src/number.c: 
	* Src/read.c: Some change in number reading (in particular for
	  string<->number conversions which were buggy when number start with
	  a #.

Thu Oct 10 09:31:51 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>


	* configure.in:
	* Src/primitives.c: Adding support por JPEG images

Sun Oct  6 23:54:28 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/stk.h:
	* Src/char.c:
	* Src/port.c: 
	* Src/sport.h:
	* Src/io.c: 
	* Src/print.c: Scheme characters were used as unsigned char without
	  explicitely specify it.  Modified some declarations to specifically
	  say that chars were unsigned.

Thu Sep 26 19:38:42 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>
	    
	* STk-3.1.1 Release

	* Demos/amib.stklos: Accessing help is now stk:show-help-file (the
	  change was not reported)

Wed Sep 25 14:40:21 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/slib.c (STk_delete_Tcl_child_Interp): new function which must
	  called by a child process just after a fork. This function is
	  necessary to allow the dynamic loading of posix.so in snow
	  (otherwise some Tk symbols are undefined).

	* Extensions/posix.c (posix_fork): Use now STk_delete_Tcl_child_Interp.

	* Src/number.c: Interface has been added for the Frank Schmuelling
	  complex-number package. Don't rely on it, since rationnal and
	  complex numbers will be present in a future release. As soon as the
	  full tower will be implemented in STk, this door will be closed.

Tue Sep 24 18:26:06 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Lib/dialog.stk: The text of the dialog was reset to a message,
	  instead of a label (when was the change done?)

Mon Sep 23 22:52:10 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/signal.c: A lot of modifications in signal handling. Major
	  rewrite of some procedures.  The '^Z' signal works again.  BTW, I
	  was unable to correctly catch a SEGV on linux (which is necessary to
	  find that no more memory is available on Linux, since malloc never
	  returns NULL this OS. Need more work.

Sun Sep 22 23:54:44 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>


	* Src/toplevel.c (finish_initialisation): replaced the hard-coded
	  call to signal when using -f option to a call to the
	  STk_set_signal_handler.

	* Src/slib.c (cannot_allocate): new private procedure called when
	  there is no more memory during a must_malloc or a must_realloc (the
	  old behaviour was incorrecte since it uses cons whereas there was no
	  more memory, conducting to a buggy report-error message). However,
	  the copy on write schem used by Linux cannot be detected by this
	  procedure. It seems that we have to wait a SIGSGV signal.

Tue Sep 17 10:03:49 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/toplevel.c: Bug correction: only create the stdin handler when
	  the process is interactive (Otherwise, STk interpreters launched in
	  backgound by system keep locked -- heavily used in the
	  Doc/README.html demo)

	* STklos/Tk/Composite/Multipaned.stklos: Orientation of Multi-paned
	  didn't work since it was done with differents keywords (:orientation
	  and :position) in some places (thanks to MIZUSHIMA Kazunori 
	  <mizkaz@keiou.trad.pfu.co.jp>)

Fri Sep 13 08:22:41 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STklos/Tk/Tk-methods.stklos: Bug correction in a method of focus
	  (Erik Ostrom <eostrom@research.att.com>)

	* Src/io.c: 
	* Src/port.c: char-ready? was incorrect when used on stdin 
	  (thanks to  Erick Ostrom)

	* STklos/Tk/Text.stklos: Correction of the value field of text
	  widgets. Tk always add a newline at end of buffer.

	* Lib/tk-init.stk (%redefine-Tk-command): After STklos was loaded,
	  each call to focus implies the loafing of file focus.stk !!

	* Extensions/socket.c: Added support for sockets on Win32 (thanks to
	  Caleb Deupree <cdeupree@erinet.com>)

	* Src/unix.c: Added the VC++ support for file globbing (thanks to
	  Caleb Deupree <cdeupree@erinet.com>)

Wed Sep 11 23:05:32 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/tk-main.c: command line argument handling for -geometry was
	  broken. Thanks to Harvey J. Stein <abel@netvision.net.il>

Fri Sep  6 18:20:28 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Extensions/stack.c: Replaced FILEPTR by PORT_FILE in the stack
	  demo. Thanks to Jean-Marie Kubek <kubek@gmm.insa-tlse.fr>

	* configure.in: Get rid of '-n' on echo commands. This option is not
	  supported under Solaris 2.x

Wed Sep  4 13:16:38 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* configure.in: X11 libs/includes in non standard place were not taken
	  into account even when a --x-libraries or a --x-includes was given
	  to the configure script.

Mon Sep  2 10:46:06 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Tk: updraded to Tk4.1p1

	* Src/eval.c: Bug correction in eval.c: arguments were not evaluated
	  when the generic function is implemented in Scheme rather than in C.
	  (Thanks to Jean-Christophe Pazzaglia <pazzagli@arsenic.unice.fr>)

	* Lib/dialog.stk: Added a binding to the dialog window that sets the
	  result to -1; this is needed in case something happens that destroys
	  the window, such as its parent window being destroyed.

Thu Aug 29 13:43:13 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/slib.c (STk_quit_interpreter): replaced Tcl_DeleteInterp by a
	  call to delete the command ".". Otherwise, when the interpreter
	  delete all the commands and find ".", the process becomes
	  recursive. This yield problems when the interpreter has already
	  allocated images.

Sat Aug 24 15:48:40 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/io.c (STk_getc): Bug correction: when a handler was set on
	  stdin, and the process was interactive, the system loops
	  indefinitely.

	* Lib/text.stk: Typo on *tk-strict-motif* for <ButtonRelease-2>

Fri Aug 23 22:24:33 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/toplevel.c (finish_initialisation): Modifications to allow
	  using stdin when using the "-f" option. Signaled by Erik Ostrom
	  <eostrom@research.att.com>

Sat Aug 17 11:21:30 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/io.c: Tcl_DoOneEvent parameter was "TK_DONT_WAIT", which is no
	  more necessary and which greatly increase cpu usage when used
	  interactively. Tcl_DoOneEvent is now 0

Tue Aug 13 18:00:10 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STklos/Tk/Composite/*.stklos: Avoid to use a (require
	  "Tk-classes") since it can condut to problem if normal widget have
	  been loaded by hand before (i.e. without using Tk-classes)

	* Lib/posix.stk: The definition of posix-access? was inverted.

	* Src/posix.c (posix_access): corrected error messages typos.

	* Mp/Makefile: replaced make by $(MAKE)

	* New directory: Doc/LaTeX-packages: This dictory contains packages	
	 which ares used in documentation but which are absent from some
	 Latex distributions.

	* Lib/process.stk: mispelling in string-append. Grrr.

	* Tk/configure: Bug correction: Not everybody has "." in its PATH.

	* Tk/unix/Makefile.in: Bug correction signalled by
	  Matthew.R.Wette@jpl.nasa.gov for X11 include files placed in non
	  standard place

	* Lib/Makefile: Bug correction signalled by
	  Matthew.R.Wette@jpl.nasa.gov when installing Lib files

	* configure.in: Changed Linux 2.x namimg scheme (I forgot that Linux
	  is now in 2.0!)

Wed Jul 24 00:04:49 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STk-3.1 Release

	* Src/stklos.c: The slot "name" in methods (which was always (buggyly)
	  set to "???")  is gone.  A new slot replace it:
	  "generic-function". The value of this slot is the generic function
	  to which the method belongs.

	  Anonymous function have a "generic-function" set to #f.

	  Potential problem: an anonymous method can be added to two different
	  GFs. In this case, the slot "generic-function" will be incorrect.
	  However, this should not be a problem since
		1. anonymous method are rare
		2. this is only used by STklos to find the class of the gf
		   (and not the gf itself) of a method when there is no
		   next-method when we applying a next-method....

	* Tk/unix/tkUnixWm.c: A lot of adaptation to Scheme (empty lists
          replaced by #f, mainly). This modificcations were needed for amib
	  whose save/restore didn't work in 3.0.

	* Tk/generic/tkPlace.c: Bug correction in the info suboption

Tue Jul 23 10:11:28 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/argv.c (STk_process_argc_argv): has been rewritten and is 
	 table driven now. Parameters are processed analysed
	 differently now: the "--" option has been added to allow a clear
	 separation between interpreter arguments and scripts arguments 
	 (as in Tcl). However, interpreter arguments must precede scripts
	 arguments (this is different from Tcl, but more Unixish).

	* Src/tk-main.c: Bug correction: if visual was incorrect the program
	 enter in an infinite loop.

	* Doc/Makefile: Tk Manuals pages are now prefixed by "stk_"
	to avoid confusion with original Tk ones. They are always placed
	in a subtree of the STk tree installation since it eases 
	the distribution of binary releases. 

	* New demo: mc-server a multiple-client server. This is a first 
	version, because this demo should be graphical to see connections
	and deconnection as they arrive. (Next release)

Mon Jul 22 15:53:44 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* BINARY_DISTRIB: description of the way to make binary releases.
	  Binary release will be stored in ftp://kaolin.unice.fr/Binary

	* Lib/init.stk:
	  Lib/Makefile.in:  Adding a site-scheme directory. This is
	  the standard directory for non standard stuff. Local scheme
	  files or extensions  can be put in this directory.

Sun Jul 21 17:53:35 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Lib/init.stk: added the variable *shared-suffix*. It is equal to
	  "so", except on HP-UX whers it is set to "sl". All the Lib/*.stk*
	  files haves been modified to use this variable rather than hardcode
	  the usual ".so".  I hope it will be OK for HP users.

	* Src/port.c (STk_open_file): new mode accepted "a" (for append).

Fri Jul 19 14:36:04 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/posix.c: 
	   - Renamed posix-access to posix-access? (old name exists
	     for compatibility but will be garbaged in afuture version)
	   - Added the constant X_OK which was missing

Thu Jul 11 22:21:30 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/posix.c: New primitives: posix_host_name and posix_domain_name
	 based on gethostname and getdomainname (POSIX.1 does not define
	 these functions, but ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990 mentions them in B.4.4.1.,
	 according to the Linux documentation.

	* Src/posix.c: New primitive: posix-uname

Fri Jul  5 19:41:38 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Lib/html.stk: Addition of the <FONT> tag with SIZE and COLOR
	  sub-tags. This must be compatible with the HTML spec.  The <COLOR>
	  tag which was STk-specific is deleted

Mon Jun 10 00:05:16 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Port implementation is different: A port contains now its
	input and output handler. String ports have been changed accordingly.
	
Sat Jun  1 21:23:01 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STk works on Win32: However, there are a lot of minor
	  things which are not correct (fonts, cursors). It seems that
	  most of this small problems are already resolved with Tk 4.1 
	  (the official one). OK, start to port from Tk4.1a2 to Tk 4.1.
	  The main probleme will very probably be with the event loop.

Mon May 27 10:42:58 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Renaming files in STklos/Tk and STklos/Tk/Composite: they have now
	a .stklos suffix (rather than .stk), because Win32 filenames are not 
	really case sensitives.

Sat May 11 08:33:22 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Integration of code modification for WIN32 port (snow only)

Fri Apr 26 09:26:10 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/primitives.c:
	* Src/gc.c:
	* Src/tcl-lib.c: Widgets don't capture anymore the environment. This
	was necessary before release 3.0, but useless now. As a matter of
	fact, widget-environment primitive has also been suppressed. Since it
	was never documented, I doubt that someone will cry for it.

	* Src/cont.c: Bug: Changed "#ifdef sun" by "#ifdef sparc" for 
	flushing the registers window Useful for Sun3 (bug signaled 
	by Michael A. Patton <MAP@BBN.com>)

	* Lib/menu.stk: Tk:option-menu: function added (identical to the 
	Tcl one)

Thu Apr 25 23:10:37 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Tk/generic/tkMenu.c: Bug correction: tearoffmenucommand was not
	defined as a closure.  

Wed Apr 24 16:21:42 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	  * Src/stklos.c: New protocol around gf: the following methods are now
	  called when an error occur with a gf call:
		  * no-next-method ((gf <generic>) args) as CLOS
		  * no-applicable-method ((gf <generic>) args) as CLOS
		  * no-method ((gf <generic>) args) when calling gf
						    without method

Tue Apr 23 23:02:26 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STklos/stklos.stk: New protocol for calling standard generic
	  functions.  This protocol is not used for real <generic> function (in
	  this case we use a completly C hard-coded protocol).  When a subclass
	  of <generic> is applied, the interpreter uses the new protocol instead
	  of the C one. This "opens" the generic function mechanism:
		  - special generic function can easily coded in Scheme (but
		    they will be slow)
		  - standard generic functions are as fast as possible.

	  This protocol provides the following generic functions:
		  * apply-generic ((gf <generic>) args)
		  * sort-applicable-methods ((gf <generic>) methods args)
		  * method-more-specific? ((m1 <method>) (m2 <method>) targs)

Mon Apr 22 23:50:18 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/boolean.c:
	* Src/proc.c:
	* Src/print.c:
	* Src/gc.c: 
	* Src/stklos.c: 
	* Src/eval.c: STklos integration. Generic functions are recognized now
	by the interpreter as standard STk objects (i.e. stklos is no more a
	dynamically loadable extension).  This integration provides:
		- faster gf (the old way to implement gf is very general and
		  is not efficient (each call to a generic function implied
		  to search the way to apply the generic function in a table).
		- gf are now properly tail recursive.

Fri Apr 19 23:53:32 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/print.c: Change -- address printing: the "#p" is no more used
	when displaying an address.  The #p is kept for Tk (of course) and
	when using write.

Sun Apr 14 19:05:50 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Demos/compo-demo.stklos: New compo-demo for <Multiple-window>

	* STklos/Tk/Composite/Multiwin.stk: 2 new composite widgets:
	<Multiple-window>: a window which can contain several windows
	<Inner-window>   : a window embedded in a <Multiple-window>
	The look is very similar to the Windows 95 explorer.

Sat Apr 13 21:58:18 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Tk/generic/tkEvent.c (Tk_AfterCmd): Bug correction for after idle

Sun Mar 31 22:38:54 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/unix.c: New primitive: setenv!

Fri Mar 29 15:06:46 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/gc.c (allocate_new_heap): Don't use must_malloc here since it
	can conduct to call GC when allocating large heaps (typically with
	large -cells xxx).

Mon Mar 25 14:20:21 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STklos/Tk/Canvas.stk: bind-for-dragging: bug correction end
	enhancement. You can now specify a :before-motion and :after-motion
	scripts. The old :motion is always accepted
	(it's equivalent to :after-motion). If the :before-motion closure
	returns #f, the object is not displaced and the :after-motion closure 
	is not applied.

Mon Feb 26 16:11:30 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STklos/stklos.stk: Two new methods are defined in STklos:
	object-eqv? and object-equal?.  They are called when doing an eqv? or
	an equal? on STklos instance.  These methods, which can of course be
	specialized, return #f.

	* Src/boolean.c: Extended types can now have a compare function which
	is called when eqv? or equal? is called. This function is called when
	one of the arguments of eq*? is of an extended type. See the document
	on Extending STk for details.

Sat Feb 24 01:47:06 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Port of STk on Tk4.1a2.
	This should simplify the port on Windows.

Mon Feb 19 17:19:49 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/toplevel.c (repl_driver): STk_interactivep was not correctly
	initialized. This seem to be a regression (or a quirk in the home &
	work files)

Fri Feb 16 14:49:48 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/number.c (do_integer_division): Correction of a bug signalled by
	Raymond Toy <toy@rtp.ericsson.se>. Integer division of bignums was
	buggy (aka Pentium symptom (except that it was always erroneous)).

Mon Feb 12 00:03:55 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Extensions/pixmap.c: Pixmap implementation uses now the file
	tixImgXpm.c from the Tix Library (Author: Ioi Kim Lam). This
	implementation doesn't need the Xpm library (which is difficult to
	locate automatically with configure script and which has several
	version with compatibily problems).

Wed Jan 24 11:52:49 1996  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Src/print.c (STk_print): Bug correction. Print of special char in
	Strings was buggy.  Thanks Drew.Whitehouse@anu.edu.au for signalling
	it.  have also added \v and \a that I have forgot.

	* STklos/Tk/Composite/Scrollcanvas.stk: Correcting a small typo error
	signaled by Ralf Berger <Ralf.Berger@ipk.fhg.de>.

Sun Jan 21 23:57:37 1996 Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* STk-3.0 (official) release (aka known as 3.0b2 since I have forgot to
	set the correct version name.

Sun Dec 10 21:37:17 1995  Erick Gallesio  <eg@biot.unice.fr (Erick Gallesio)>

	* Src/promise.c (STk_force):
	Bug correction for recursive expression in a force. It is now conform
	to R4RS.
	   (define c #f)
	   (define p (delay (if c 100 (begin (set! c #t) (+ (force p) 1)))))
	returns now the value 100 (and not 101).
	This bug was raised with test.scm.

	*******************
	Changelog was not maintained for a while. I will try to update 
	it later. Sorry.

Mon Jul 17 20:55:27 1995  Erick Gallesio  <eg@kaolin.unice.fr (Erick Gallesio)>
	
	* 2.2 Release
	* Src/syntax.c (STk_syntax_begin): begin, and & or were not always
	tail recursives. This bug was detected (and corrected) by  Lars Thomas
	Hansen <lth@cs.uoregon.edu>
	* Doc/Reference/Reference2.tex: Documentation of new hash tables

Sun Jul 16 10:30:26 1995  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Snow/run-snow.in: 
	* Src/run-stk.in: I have changed the machine determination scheme 
	to avoid problems on Sun (sun4m sun4 sun4c... are all the same, at 
	least for STk). For Linux, there is no more differerence between 
	the Intel rocessor used for compiling STk (i{345}86 are all the same).

	* Src/dynload.c: 
	* Src/configure.in:
	* Src/Makefile.in:
	* configure.in:
	* Makefile.in: Support for ELF format under Linux. Thanks to
	Johann Friedrich Heinrichmeyer and <jsc2mit.edu>

	* Src/slib.c (STk_machine_type):
	* Src/toplevel.c (print_banner): MACH define has been changed by MACHINE
	to avoid problems with Mach systems.

Sat Jul 16 23:30:27 1995  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Doc/Extension/Extending.tex: Adding documentation for Tcl widget 
	integration

Thu Jul 13 09:04:54 1995  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>

	* Doc/Reference/Appendix-D.tex: Description of Ilisp, CMU Scheme packages
	* Doc/Manual/stk.txt: New manual page. Manual page is now installed in 
	$(prefix)/man/man1/stk.1
	
	* Src/error.c (STk_err): Don't print a line number when error comes from 
	stdin. 

	* Src/stk.h: 
	* Src/toplevel.c: 
	* Src/argv.c: New option: -interactive to force the
	interpreter to be interactive, even if it doesn't seem to
	be. This is useful when using STk under Emacs. 
	When STk is interactive, stdout and stderr are now unbuffered.
	* Src/port.c (STk_init_standard_ports): line buffering of Stderr has been 
	deleted. Everything is done now in toplevel.c (depends on the
	-interactive flag

	* Lib/regexp.stk: Bug correction in regexp-replace-all when replacing
	string appears in the string to replace. Correction is due to
	Sean Slattery <jslttery@GS148.SP.CS.CMU.EDU>

Wed Jul 12 09:57:10 1995  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr (Erick Gallesio)>

	* Src/syntax.c (syntax_let_family): Don't signal an error if a
	symbol is defined twice in a let*. Formal semantics given in R4RS
	allows it (whereas textual explanation seems to forbid it.
	Problem was found by Brent Knight <knight@CS.Cornell.EDU>.

	* Src/port.c: New definition of macro READ_DATA_PENDING for
	ELF compiling. Thanks to Jin S. Choi <jsc@tabitha.atype.com>
	for the bug correction.

	* Lib/init.stk: Macros are now defined in the global environment. 
	This avoids problems when some primitives procedure are redefined.
	All the primitive should be protected for those redefinitions.

	* Lib/Makefile (install): prolog.ps is now placed in the good directory

	* Tk/tkCanvas.c (CanvasWidgetCmd): Correction of a bug signaled by
	Johann Friedrich Heinrichmeyer. The result of the poscript command
	must be "stringified".
	

Tue Jul 11 21:16:17 1995  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr (Erick Gallesio)>

	* STklos/Tk/Canvitem.stk (initialize-item): INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE
	<Text> in canvas has been renamed in <Canvas-text> to avoid a conflict 
	when using both cnavases and texts widgets.
	Demos have been modified to take this modification into account

	* STklos/Tk/Composite/Scrollcanvas.stk (<Scroll-canvas>):
	* STklos/Tk/Composite/Scrollbox.stk (<Scroll-listbox>): Bug correction in 
	background propagation. (Bug signaled by H. J. Stein)
 

Tue Jul 11 16:31:44 1995  Erick Gallesio  <eg@kaolin.unice.fr (Erick Gallesio)>

	* Correction of several bugs signaled by Eric Ostrom on text widget

Fri Jul  7 23:27:17 1995  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr (Erick Gallesio)>

	* Tk/tkWindow.c (Tk_CreateMainWindow): 
	* Src/toplevel.c (init_interpreter): Init system path from
	STK_LIBRARY shell variable. This variable MUST be initialized now
	(this is done in the stk or snow scripts). This allows us to make 
	binaries which are independant of their location. This will permit 
	to distribute binaries on kaolin.

	* Src/hash.c: Modification of the hash table module to take into
	account an optional parameter which specifies the comparison function.
	This permits to have equal? eqv? eq? or string? hash tables for instance
	
Tue Jul  4 14:04:49 1995  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr (Erick Gallesio)>

	* Src/port.c:
	* Src/sport.c: Minor code cleaning (using STk_is_thunk)

Fri Jun 23 22:27:26 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* STklos/Tk/Composite/Scrolltext.stk (<Scroll-text>): bug correction
	in background propagation	

Mon Jun  5 18:03:47 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* STk-2.1.7 release

	* Extensions/posix.c: An extension for using Posix primitives in
	Scheme.  Far from complete. This is just a start. Any help on this
	point would be appreciated.

	* Doc/Extension/Extending.tex: A new version which is more (but not
	totally :-<) complete.  
	* Extensions/stack.c: a new file used for illustating the document
	  "Extending the STk interpreter"

	* Demos/amib.stklos: A new version of the interfac builder which
	is usable now. This version handle the packer and the placer.

	* STklos/Tk/Composite/Multipaned.stk (initialize-composite-widget):
	  Addition of the Multipaned composite widget. Thanks to Harvey J. Stein,
	  for his modifications.

Sat Jun  3 00:44:53 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* Lib/init.stk:
	* Src/syntax.c: Rewritting of "while" and "unless" in C

	* A new type: tc_ssubr. This type is temporary and will change in
	 the next release.  This type correspond to all n-ary functions of
	 number.c.  Correction of an ENNORMEOUS bug: There was a double
	 evaluation when fsubr where called by apply!!!. Fsubr cannot be
	 applyed now (ssubr are the only procedure with non evaluated
	 parameter which can be appyed.

	* Src/proc.c (STk_procedurep): (Procedure? a-tk-command) => #t now
	* Lib/inspect-misc.stk (inspect::typeof obj): correction of a bug
	introcuced in the inspector by previous modification

Fri Jun  2 00:07:20 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* Src/gf.c (find_method): Code cleaning.

Thu Jun  1 19:29:39 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* Src/port.c (do_load): I have added a comment when a file has
	  finished to be loaded, as suggested by David Fox.

	* Src/gc.c (gc_sweep): GC calls now Tcl_DeleteCommand when a new
	  command is deleted. See below ...  

	* Src/tcl-lib.c: Modifications of {Create,Delete}Interp and
	  {Create,Delete}Command to really execute the detete code of a
	  Tk-command. This seems to be useful only for the send command
	  annd "."  command (but would also be probably useful for future
	  tcl extensions).  The "send" associated delete proc permits to
	  unregister the interpreter from the X server (bug signalled by
	  Sean Slattery slttery@GS148.SP.CS.CMU.EDU and that I have never
	  seen !!!!).

Mon May 29 17:04:53 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* STklos/Tk/Message.stk (<Message>): Deleteing the class
	  <Tk-sizeable> from <Message> class. This was erroneous.

Fri May 26 23:52:40 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* STklos/Tk/Toplevel.stk (<Toplevel>): Adding the :init-keyword
	  for class and display slots. This modification was necessary for
	  the new AMIB.  Min-size and max-size slots contain now a string
	  and class and display slots contain a string (it was a symbol) 

	* STklos/Tk/Frame.stk (<Frame>): Adding the :init-keyword for
	  class slot Class slot contains a string (it was a symbol)

Fri May 19 22:44:59 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* Src/sport.c (STk_get_output_string): Correction of a bug
	  signalled by Fritz.Heinrichmeyer@fernuni-hagen.de

Wed May  3 12:59:24 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* STklos/Tk/Composite/Paned.stk (motion-grip): Applying the patch
	  of Harvey J. Stein <hjstein@MATH.HUJI.AC.IL> which constraints
	  the grip ]0..1[ This permits to avoid its disappearance.

Tue May  2 00:05:55 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* STklos/Tk/Tk-methods.stk: This file is always loaded now (it was
	  loaded only when Tk was initialized before). Read the comment in
	  this file when re-using STk images. *top-root* initialization is
	  in Tk-methods.stk rather than Toplevel.stk now.

	* Lib/tk-init.stk (Tk:initialized?): a new variable which is set
	  to #t when Tk is fully initialized


Mon May  1 16:55:18 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* Src/stklos.c (display_instance): 
	* Src/error.c (STk_err): 
	* Src/eval.c (STk_show_eval_stack): 
	* Src/port.c (STk_write): 
	* Src/tk-glue.c (STk_convert_for_tk): 
	* Src/toplevel.c (repl_loop): 
	* Src/extend.c (internal_display): 
	* Src/print.c (STk_print):    All those files have been modified for
	  giving the port (a SCM object) to the procedure which do a print
	  rather than a FILE *, which is more general. This modification is
	  necessary for permitting a real display_object in extension.  STklos
	  uses this for the {write,display,tk-write}-object methods.

Tue Apr 25 14:57:48 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/number.c (STk_gcd): Bug correction in lcm, gcd, min and max (arguments
	  were evaluated several times!!!!). 

Tue Apr 18 14:55:23 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* STklos/Tk/Composite/Scrolltext.stk: New file. It implements what
	  you think it should!!

	* STklos/Tk/Composite/Scrollcanvas.stk: New file. It implements
	what you think it should!!

	* STklos/Tk/Composite/Scrollbox.stk (<Scroll-listbox>): Scroll
	listbox accept now horizontal scrollbar.

Sat Apr 15 15:40:40 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* Tk/tkListbox.c (ListboxWidgetCmd): Correction of an old old bug:
	Getting an element of listbox always retusrns a string. However,
	this modification breaks down the inspector.... (it is time to
	rewrite it....)

Fri Apr 14 23:32:42 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* Src/number.c (STk_round): Bug correction. (Round x) must returns
	the closest integer to x, rounding to even when x is halfway
	between two integers.

Fri Mar 31 00:15:36 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* Src/configure.in: Adding test for the existence of the pid_t
	type.  This is needed for porting STk on Sony WS (Sony NEWS,
	NEWSOS 4.2R) Thanks to Nobuyuki Hikichi <hikichi@sra.co.jp>

	* Lib/init.stk (random): have been extended to allow the result to
	be a bignum. Here again, thanks to Nobuyuki Hikichi
	<hikichi@sra.co.jp>

Sat Mar 25 23:33:54 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* STk/read.c: Modification of the reader to remember current
	filename and line counters. This eases debugging since error
	messages can display those informations.

Thu Mar 16 15:32:59 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/extend.c (STk_define_C_variable): New function. This
	function permit to establish a link between a C variable and a
	Scheme one. Once this link is established, every reading of the
	variable will call a getter function and every write will call the
	setter function. No data is used in the Scheme space, variable
	value is a C data.

Wed Mar 15 17:21:40 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* New primitive type: C-pointer. This is a Scheme type to wrap a C
	pointer.  It greatly eases communication with C.

	* Src/extend.c: New file. This file contains all the code for
	extensions and C pointers. It contains a ot of code from old
	dynload.c.  File dynload.c contains now only the function which do
	dynamic loadind (and which is very sytem dependant.

Tue Mar 14 13:30:11 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/slib.c (STk_internal_eval_string): Bug correction. The error
	context was false.

Fri Mar 10 15:55:47 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/userinit.c (STk_user_cleanup): STk_user_cleanup has been added. 

	* Src/port.c (STk_init_standard_ports): Error file is now line
	buffered. This gives better performances when used under emacs.


Thu Mar  9 12:49:43 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Added support for dynamic loading under Linux (with DLD). Code
	is inspired from a contribution of Patrick Nguyen
	(pnguyen@elde.epfl.ch)

Sun Mar  5 16:06:11 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* Src/port.c (STk_char_readyp): Added support for char-ready. Code
	should not be very portable...

Sat Feb 25 11:51:45 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* Src/slib.c (STk_get_internal_info): Bug correction: the result
	was completely erroneous. Is it possible that I have tested this
	function without having seen this????

	* Dynamic loading should work for OSF1 (Thanks to Erik Ostrom
	<eostrom@radon.ccs.neu.edu>)

Sun Feb 12 18:00:15 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* 2.1.6 release

Sat Feb 11 23:23:15 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* Src/env.c (STk_parent_environment): New function. It was time to
	write it...

	* Src/port.c (STk_error): Set context to ERR_OK but keep the bit
	indicating if error must be caught or not.

	* New version of blt for STk. Some minor changes for compiling it
	with new C conventions.

Thu Feb  9 23:21:52 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@unice.fr)

	* STklos/Tk/Basics.stk: Tk::find-option is defined as autoload to
	permit image creation.

	* STklos/Tk/Toplevel.stk: Definition of *top-root* is deferred
	until first <Toplevel> creation (to allow image creation)

	* STklos/Tk/Tk-methods.stk: New file. This file contains the
	redefinition of Tk commands as methods. This file is loaded when
	the first Tk object is really created. Deferring the loading of
	this file permits to make images of interpreters containing Tk
	classes.


Thu Feb  2 23:15:15 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* Src/unix.c (absolute): Bug correction for file name with mutiple
	dots such as "...1../2" which were improperly expanded

	* Src: Yeaaah. All the symbols defined by STk are now prefixed by
	"STk_".  It tooks me some days to obtain this. I take this
	occasion to pass through the code and try to ameliorate things
	rather than using brute force.

Wed Feb  1 02:17:12 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* Socket support has been rewritten. It is now configured by
	default.  New model seems more simple (at least for me) and more
	coherent with the process extension.

Tue Jan 31 10:30:29 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Modification of all Makefile to use $(MAKE) rather than make as
	suggested by Christian Lynbech <lynbech@daimi.aau.dk>

Mon Jan 30 15:22:06 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Tk/tkConfig.h: Modifications for HPUX.

Sun Jan 29 15:11:06 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* Src/process.c: Completely cleaned up. Table of processes is
	managed by the SIGCHLD signal if it exists. On machines without
	job control, process management is done by hand. Some new function
	have been added (suggested on the mailing list by Giorgio Cesana
	<cesana@venus.agcis.st.it>): process-exit-status, process-stop,
	process-continue, process-send-signal.

	(run_process): A new option: ":host" which permits to execute the command 
	on a distant host.

Mon Jan 23 12:07:23 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/tk-main.c (Tk_main): adding code for managing argument line
	-geometry option. It was missing....

	* Src/stklos.c (make_primitive_classes): Adding the new primitive
	class <list> which is the ancestor of <pair> and <null>. Suggested
	by Harvey J. Stein (hjstein@math.huji.ac.il)

Sun Jan 22 18:12:02 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* Demos/inspector.stk: A small demo, for showing usage of the
	inspector with Tk object. A very simple thing but this seems to be
	rather unknown.

Sat Jan 21 23:01:15 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* Src/read.c (lreadr): Cosmetic changes. Using the sym_XXX
	variables instead of interning them at each time.

	* Src/gc.c (allocate_new_heap): Setting of the field gc_mark to 0
	for all new allocated cell. Thanks to Chet Murphy
	<murthy@CS.Cornell.EDU> for this bug correction.

	* Src/toplevel.c (init_interpreter): Bug correction: sym_unquote
	was gc protected twice whereas sym_unquote_splicing was not. A
	cut/paste error which took 2 days to debug :-(


Mon Jan  9 12:06:08 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Configure and Mafefile files modifications to allow dynamic
	loading under Irix 5.3. Thanks to Michael Tiemann
	<tiemann@cygnus.com> for the patches.

Sun Jan  1 21:10:45 1995  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* One important thing :-) Adding 1995 in all the files which
	contains a copyright notice. This is the good day for doing that
	(an only that!).

Fri Dec 30 17:56:40 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* New organization of Tcl files. All The Tcl files have been
	updated to release 7.4b1 (the Tcl release that comes with Tk
	4.0b1).  The file Src/tcl-util.c has shrink a lot and most of it
	is now in Tcl/tlUtil.c (in fact a copy of the original file with
	some #ifdefs).  This last change is break the previous philosophy
	of libtcl.a (a library of Tcl file *unmodified*) but changes are
	minor and I hope that it will ease the port to new version of
	Tcl/Tk which semble very instable at this time.

Wed Dec 28 18:14:22 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* Lib/error.stk (report-error): Modification of error message format

	* Src/primitives.c: Deleting the definition of the "lindex"
	primitive which doesn't serve anymore.

Tue Dec 20 12:02:00 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/syntax.c (syntax_define): "Bug" correction: When using a
	local "define", There was a duplication of the binding if the
	symbol was already defined in the out most environment. Since the
	new binding was placed before the older one, good value was
	found. However, it makes environment bigger than necessary
	(and strange result when using environment->list).

	* Src/env.c (value_in_env): New function. It returns the value of
	var in given env. Search is done only at out most level. This
	function is an utility function for local "define".

Mon Dec 19 12:08:31 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/stk.h (MAX_CHAR_CODE): Correct value is 255 (it was 256)

Fri Dec 16 16:06:57 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* STk 2.1.5 release

Fri Dec 16 13:56:25 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/dynload.c: Adding support for HPUX (thanks to ipankar Gupta
	<dg@hplb.hpl.hp.com>)


Fri Dec  9 22:15:34 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* Snow/run-snow.in: There is now a new interpreter, called snow
	(for Scheme NO Window), which is the STk interpreter without Tk
	support.  This interpreter is an independant executable. It can be
	called with the snow shell-script or by unsetting the DISPLAY
	variable.

Thu Dec  8 22:47:44 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* Makefile.in: Modifications of all configure.in and Makefile.in. 
	Now we can 
		- share versions of STk between different architectures
		- have several versions of STk installed on the same machine

Wed Dec  7 21:46:44 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* Src/dynload.c (load_object_file): Adding dynamic loading support
	for NetBSD-1.0 (i386-port). Thanks to Franke Ruediger
	(Ruediger.Franke@rz.tu-ilmenau.de) for the patch.

Tue Dec  6 00:26:48 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* Src/tk-glue.c (execute_Tk_lib_cmd): GC bug correction. There was a
	bug when a GC occured during the creation of the argv array of a Tk
	command. This bug occured on Linux with -O2; Correcting it doesn't arrange
	things==> Usage of an equivalent code. Thanks to H. Stein for signaling this bug.


Sat Nov 26 10:46:58 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* Src/stklos.c: Changing all the "class" variables by "clath" for
	C++ users

	* Src/port.c (loadfile): All the code for loading file is now
	written in C and things are more "orthogonal".  New variable
	defined: *load-suffixes*.

	* Src/toplevel.c (repl_driver): Move of user init initialisation
	so taht they are taken into account in case of a "stk -f" (thanks
	to Brian Webb webbb@aies.tucson.saic.com)

Wed Nov  9 13:54:34 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* STk-2.1.4 release

Thu Nov  3 23:20:06 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* A New datatype: regular expressions. They are defined in a
	dynamic loadable file (for the regexp compiler and the apply
	function) and in a Scheme file
	(mainly for the regexp-replace[-all] procedures

Wed Nov  2 16:49:07 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* file-is-xxx? and file-exists? are now written in C

	* Elimination of %file and %string Tcl command. Those commands
	were used behind the scene to avoid some rewriting. No code in the
	distribution should use them.  This conduct to the defineition of
	two new primitives string-index and file-is-executable? (which was
	forgotten in previous releases).

Mon Oct 31 11:04:27 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* Src/hash.c (hash_table_stats): Circumvent a bug in Tcl code on
	empty hash tables (see comment in source file)

Fri Oct 28 14:23:36 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* STklos/Tk/Toplevel.stk (<Toplevel>): All the "wm" Tk-command
	options are now available through Toplevel slot accesses (Idea
	from Rob Deline) A New global variable: *top-root*: This is a
	toplevel which contains the *root* window. Changing the name of
	the root window can now be done by
	    (set! (title *top-root*) "New title")

Tue Oct 18 14:42:55 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/number.c (lround): Rewritten to avoid the use of the rint(3)
	function which does'nt seems to exist on some systems (SCO and
	some HP at least)

Mon Oct 17 18:29:31 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* Lib/editor.stk (stk:all-fonts): Various font specifications
	changes (those which where used in all the Lib directory where not
	portable.

Mon Oct 17 11:38:17 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/slib.c (lrandom): Bug correction (bignum where not allowed
	  as parameter => (random(random 10)) was invalid since result of
	  random is always a bignum
	  (bug signaled by  Markus Armbruster <armbru@pond.sub.org>)

Fri Oct 14 09:02:12 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* New procedure: run-process which permit to run a process with
	 redirection off the stdin, stdout and stderr. The code is a
	 rewriting of the Alexander Taranov, Grygory Niconov and David
	 Tolpin contribution.

Thu Oct 13 14:56:05 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/number.c: Add a rint compatible function for systems which
	desn't provide one (SCO apparently -- signaled by
	markd@grizzly.com)

Wed Oct 12 15:12:51 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* New functions for port manipulation (port->string
	  port->string-list ....)  With those function, it is easy to
	  write a Tcl-like exec.  All those function are written in
	  Scheme.

Tue Oct 11 15:53:49 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/slib.c (set_random_seed): modified to allow bignums for the seed.

Mon Oct 10 14:16:52 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Minor modifications to allow a better compilation on some C and C++
	compilers.

Sun Oct  9 18:19:01 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@biot)

	* Bug correction: the eval_stack (which serves ONLY for displaying
	context upon error was not corectly managed on "tail recursion
	elimination". This leads to memory consumption on infinites loops.

Tue Sep 27 11:46:01 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* STklos/tk-classes.stk: Creation of a new file which define a set
	of autoloads. Those autoload permits to avoid to use a long list
	of require at the beginning of programs

	* Src/port.c (do_autoload): Adding support for autoload in C. Now,
	any kind of symbol can be autoloaded.

Thu Sep 15 16:36:01 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* 2.1.3 Release

Wed Sep 14 18:52:14 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/stklos.c (make_instance): GC bug correction in a critical
	section of code.

	* Src/macros.c (lmacro): GC bug correction in a critical section
	of code.

	* Src/symbol.c (intern): modification of a critical section of
	code a GC could occur between the hash table entry creation and
	the end of its initialization. Correction of the same kind of
	problem in keyword.c.  Bug discovered by Rob Deline.

	* Src/stklos.c (modify_instance): Bug correction (change-class
	make a twist between old and new instance) ==> following GC free
	the bad instance data !!

Fri Sep  9 13:40:12 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Packing of the STk2.1.2 release

Thu Sep  8 09:27:16 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* STklos/stklos.c: Definition of a slot_set_if_unbound which only
	affect a slot if needed. This function is used in the slots
	initialization process.  Now, things are corrects when a slot
	:initform is overloaded by inheritance or when initialization is
	done in an initialize followed by a next-method
	(i.e. it's the user value which is taken instead of the default one).

	* Src/gc.h: re-integretate gc_protect (can be useful for extension
	writers)

	* After 3 days continuations are tail recursive..... I thought I
	will become crazy before I found the little typing mistake (a
	lsubr instaed of a tsubr in primitives.c) which makes things
	weird.

Mon Sep  5 18:37:16 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Symbols and keywords use now Tcl Hash table (which grow
	dynamically).  Keywords share now memory. This reduces drastically
	space occupation. (Old symbol table uses conses, and keywords
	where not shared). Unused symbols can be GCed now.

	* Change class bug correction (Thanks to Rob Deline).

Fri Sep  2 11:41:04 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* -image can be specified needs not anymore to be the first
	argument of the command line.

	* Src/argv.c: "-cells" can be specified when calling stk. This
	give the amount of cells created upon init.

Wed Aug 31 14:17:44 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/argv.h (save_unix_args_and_environment): moved to
	argv.c. This new file contains all the argc/argv/env stuff. STk
	doesn't rely anymore on Tk code for parsing command line
	arguments. This permits to have a arguments processing even if not
	compiled with -DUSE_TK.

Tue Aug 30 13:39:53 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Tk/tkArgv.c (Tk_ParseArgv): 

	* Src/gc.c (init_gc): GC complete revision: Now we have a set of
	heaps and a new heap is allocated as soon as the global space is
	"nearly" filled (I have fixed nearly to 75%). User can maually
	grow the heap by using extend-heap.  There are time statitics now
	indicating how much time is spent in GC.

Mon Aug 29 12:35:05 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/cont.c (throw): bug correction in
	continuations. Specifically, the gc_mark phase for the
	continuation blocks may fail because the stack starting and ending
	addresses used in the code are both (char *), not (SCM *),
	aligned, and the stack is copied in bytes, not in SCMs.  on char *
	rather than SCM. This bug was discoverred by Felix Wu
	(wu@cadence.com)

	* Adding SLIB support (i.e. I have written the STk.init
	file). Some modifications in stk.init were needed (accepting the
	".scm" suffix mainly)

	* Src/macros.c (expand): Cleanup in macros. We have now
	macro-expand and macro-expand-1

Thu Aug 25 15:59:33 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/number.c (do_integer_division): bug correction for
	modulo. The fix is due to kerch@parc.xerox.com.

Wed Aug 24 12:02:41 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Src/number.c (integerp): Bug correction. integer? must returns
	#t even if the value is an inexact integer.

	* port.c: - modification to allow close-port on string-port 
	          - if the first char of a filename is a pipe ("|") character,
		  usage of popen instead of fopen. This permits to define
		  "pipe ports" very easily as in Tcl.

	* Integration of the Suresh Srinivas STk-wtour demo to the
	Contrib. Some minor bugs have been fixed and some new lessons have
	been added. Hierarchy was modified to fit to the contrib
	directory.

Tue Aug 23 17:16:34 1994  Erick Gallesio  (eg@kaolin.unice.fr)

	* Definition of a file compatibility file which assume compatibily
	among versions. When this file is loaded, a message will be
	printed, saying that you have to upgrade your source.

	* Adding support for Text in STklos Definition of a new version of
	the STF format (0.2) which permits to load and save files with
	their enhancment (font, color, ...). Now, tags can be dynamically
	created (instead of choosen in a fixed list).  A compatibility
	mode is provided (see above)
