    <h1>Envdraw</h1>


EnvDraw is a environment diagramming package which draws environment
diagrams as taught in Abelson and Sussman's _Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Languages_.  It was written as an
instructional tool for the CS61A course at the University of
California at Berkeley.  The environment diagrammer is a metacircular
evaluator which draws procedures, environments, and box and pointer
diagrams along with all the accompanying symbols and mutation.  It
includes a box and pointer diagrammer which handles circular list
structures, cons cell mutation, and also will watch for modification
of any symbols known to be pointing to drawn cells.
