		    This is the release 3.1 of STk
		   --------------------------------


(Last release is always available from kaolin.unice.fr [193.48.229.225])

STk is a R4RS Scheme interpreter which can access the Tk graphical
package.  Concretely it can be seen as the John Ousterhout's Tk
package where the Tcl language has been replaced by Scheme.

STk also provides an efficient object oriented system called STklos.
STklos is an extensive OO system with multiple inheritance, generic
functions, multi-methods and a Meta Object Protocol).

This release runs on several Unix boxes (see below) and on Microsoft
Win32. It uses the Tk 4.1 package for the graphical part.

DIFFERENCE PREVIOUS RELEASE
---------------------------

	- Version of Tk is now at Tk4.1 level. 

	- STk run now on Win32!!! 
	Some details need a little more work (some oddities on file names
	due to difference conventions between Unix and DOS, and things like 
	that). No socket support and no dynamic loading on Win32

	- A complete documentation of STk widgets pages (both in nroff 
	and HTML format). The help command really allow you to browse
	man pages now. Man pages are prefixed by "stk_" now to avoid confusion 
	with original Tk manual pages. 

	- STklos is now integrated to STk (it was dynamically loaded before).
	  This simplify its implementation and speed up generic functions:
		o gf are now 2-4 time faster
		o gf are now tail recursive
		o the MOP for gf is now "public" (i.e. you can change the way 
		  gf are called in Scheme -- it was not possible with previous 
		  versions without using C).

	- Port implementation is different: A port contains now its
	input and output handler. New primitives to access the handler:
	when-port-readable and when-port-writable.
	BTW, The Tk function fileevent function is no more useful
	(it is written in Scheme now for compatibility, but its usage 
	is deprecated). It may not be supported in a future release.

	- New composite widgets: <Multiple-window> and <Inner-window>
	which allow to have embedded windows. A multiple window 
	has a task bar below and allow to iconify inner-windows. 
	Some people think it looks like Win95 desktop ;-)	

	- pixmap extension doesn't require anymore the Xpm library. Code
	is stolen from the Tix Library.

	- New socket code which allow multiple concurrent connection

	- Extended types can now have a compare function which	is called
	 when eqv? or equal? is called. This modification should be 
	 compatible with the previous extensions (I hope so)
	
	- STklos: Two new methods: object-eqv? and object-equal? which are 
	called when applying eqv? or equal? to instances.

	- A rewriting of bind-for-dragging canvas method. You can now specify 
	a :before-motion, which if it returns #f, forbid to move the selected 
	canvas item.

	- New primitives:setenv!, posix-host-name, posix-domain-name, 
	posix-uname	  
	
	- Option separator "--" allows to pass reserved keyword 
	  (such as -help) to a script. Option and parameter cannot
	   be mixed anymore:
		stk xyz -help ==> *argv* = ("xyz" "-help")

	- HTML browser enhancement (support of the <FONT> tag with SIZE 
	  and COLOR sub-tags. This must be compatible with the HTML spec. 

	- and of course many many bug corrections.

See file 'CHANGES' in the distribution main directory for more informations.

SCHEME WITHOUT TK
-----------------

Standard make build a light version of STk which does not provide support for
the Tk toolkit. This interpreter, called Snow (Scheme with NO Window), can be
called directly with the 'snow' shell script. It is implicitly called if 
your DISPLAY variable is not set.

LEARNING STk
------------

In Contrib/STk-wtour, you'll find a program (called stk-wtour) which is a kind
of tutorial for programming widgets in STk. This program, which is a
contribution of Suresh Srinivas (ssriniva@cs.indiana.edu), is an excellent 
starting point for learning basics of STk widgets programming.

FILE ORGANIZATION
-----------------

Stk
  |___ Contrib	   The contributors directory
  |___ Demos	   some original Tk demos rewritten for stk plus some other
  |                stuff found on  the net. 
  |___ Extensions  This directory contains extensions of the core interpreter
  |		   (hash tables, POSIX.1 support). See the README file for more 
  |		   details
  |___ Doc	   Documentation of STk.		   
  |___ Help	   Various (HTML) help files for STk.
  |___ Lib	   a set of Scheme files used by the interpreter
  |___ Src	   contains source files of stk (i.e. the sources files of the 
  |		   interpreter + some glue files between Tk and Scheme).
  |___ Snow	   contains (mostly) links over Src files. This directory 
  |		   is used to build snow the Scheme interpreter without Tk
  |		   support
  |___ STklos      an CLOS-like object extension of Scheme based on the
  |    |	   Tiny CLOS package.
  |    |_ Tk       A library of Tk objects based on the STklos object
  |    |	   extension package (subdirectory Composite contains
  |    |	   composite widgets definitions	
  |    |_ Examples A (small) set of examples written in STklos.
  |___ Tcl	   contains a set of unchanged files of the Tcl library which 
  |		   pertain in Stk
  |___ Tk 	   contains a modified version of the Tk library. Most of the
